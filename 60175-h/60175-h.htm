<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER ONE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Petulantly Nancy Howard cast aside
her letter and buried her chin in her
cupped palms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the woes of having a learned father!”
she sighed. “Here is Joe’s letter, telling me
how everything is starting up at home; and
here am I, Nancy Howard, buried in this
picturesque, polyglot wilderness, just because
my sire feels himself moved to take a vacation
from medicine in order to study history at
first hand! I wish he would let his stupid
monograph go to the winds, and take me
home in time for the Leighton’s dinner, next
week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She picked up the scattered sheets of her
letter and ran them over once more, holding
up her left hand, as she did so, to cut off the
dazzling sunshine from the white paper. It
was a pretty hand, slim, strong and tapering.
Prettier still was her head, erect and crowned
with piles of reddish-brown hair. It was not
without apparent reason that Nancy Howard
had been, for the past year, one of the most
popular girls of her social circle at home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the third page, her brows wrinkled
thoughtfully. Dropping the loose sheets into
her lap, she once more fell to musing aloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It does seem to me that Joe is seeing a
good deal of Persis Routh. I never thought
he liked her especially well. But anyway I
am out of all the fun. Space isn’t the only
thing that makes distance. Up here, I am at
least two hundred years away from home.
How long have I been here? Eight, no, nine
days.” Suddenly she laughed. “At least, it
has been a period of fasting and meditation.
I believe I’ll count it as a novena to the Good
Sainte Anne. Perhaps she will manufacture a
miracle in my behalf, and get up a little excitement
for me. Fancy an excitement in this
place!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“B’jour, mam’selle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy turned alertly, as the voice broke in
upon her musings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bon jour, madame,” she answered, with a
painstaking French which laid careful stress
upon each silent letter and separated the words
into an equal number of distinct sentences.
At present, it was her latest linguistic accomplishment,
and she aired it with manifest
pride.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pausing midway over the stile, the old
woman brushed her face with the apron that
hung above her tucked-up skirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not you go to the church?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy breathed a sigh of relief, as the talk
lapsed into her mother tongue. Like most
Americans, she preferred that conversational
eccentricities should be entirely upon the other
side, and she questioned how far she could go
upon the strength of her own three words.
Nevertheless, she framed her reply on the
idioms of her companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why for should I go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman set down her pail of water on
the top step of the stile. Then she planted
herself just below it, with her coarse boots
resting on the crisp brown turf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We go to church, all the days,” she admonished
Nancy sternly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl smiled irrepressibly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I have noticed,” she said, half under
her breath. Then she added hastily, “But we
do not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you Catholique?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too bad! But surely you can pray in
any church.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time, Nancy felt a rebuke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she assented; “but I am not used
to going, every day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. No?” The second <span class='it'>no</span> was plainly
interrogative. “But the Good Sainte Anne
only does those miracle to them that pray
without ceasing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl faced about sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame Gagnier, have you ever seen a
miracle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The wide flat hat nodded assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A real, true miracle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, so many.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hh! I’d like to see one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two keen old eyes peered up at her from
beneath the wide hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mam’selle does not believe?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was reproach in the accent; but the
girl answered undauntedly,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not one bit. I’ll wait till I have seen
one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Gagnier shrugged her shoulders
ever so slightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How shall you see, having no eyes at
all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s brown eyes snapped in defiant contradiction
of the slight put upon them. It was
no part of her plan to be drawn into theological
discussion. However, theological discussion
being forced upon her, she had no mind to
give way. Motherless from her childhood,
Nancy Howard had never been trained in the
purely feminine grace of suppressing her opinions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I not only have eyes; but I have a little
common sense,” she answered aggressively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next instant, she was conscious of a
sudden wave of contrition. Madame Gagnier
unclasped her wrinkled hands and crossed herself
devoutly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then may the Good Sainte Anne open
your eyes!” she responded, with gentle simplicity.
“You carry her name. Pray that
she take you under her protection, and work
this miracle in your behalf. She is all-gracious,
and her goodness has not any limits
at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Impulsively the girl rose from her seat on
the ground, crossed to the stile and dropped
down on its lowest step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madame Gagnier, I was very rude,” she
said, with equal simplicity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then silence dropped over them, the silence
of the country and of the past. Forgetful of
the letter she had let slip to the ground, forgetful
of the coarse, mannish boots beside her
own dainty ties, the girl allowed her gaze to
wander back and forth across the view. It
had grown so familiar to her during the last
nine days, interminable days to the energetic,
society-loving American girl who had chafed at
her exile from the early gayeties of the awakening
season in town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fifty feet away stood her temporary prison,
a long, narrow stone house coated with shining
white plaster. Above its single story, the
pointed roof shot up sharply, broken by two
dormer windows and topped with a chimney
at either end, the one of stone, the other of
brick. The palings in front of the house
were white, dotted with their dark green
posts; but, the house once passed, the neat
palings promptly degenerated into a post-and-rail
fence guiltless of paint and crossed
with a stile at important strategic points connected
with the barn. For one hundred feet
in front of the house, the smooth-cropped lawn
rolled gently downward. Then it dropped
sharply from the crest of the bluff in an almost
perpendicular grassy wall reaching down to the
single long street of Beaupré, two hundred
feet below. The crest of the bluff was dotted
by an occasional farmhouse, each reached by
its zigzag trail up the slope; but, in the street
beneath, the houses met in two continuous,
unbroken lines, parallel to that other continuous
line of the mighty river. The river was
mud-colored, to-day; and the turf about her
was browned by early frosts; but the Isle of
Orleans lay blue in the middle distance, and,
far to the north, Cap Tourmente rested in a
purple haze. At her feet, the white sail of
a stray fishing-boat caught the sunlight and
tossed it back to her, and, nearer still, the gray
twin spires of Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré rose in
the clear October air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother of the Holy Virgin, protector of
sailors, healer of the faithful, patron saint of
the New France.” Dame Gagnier was rehearsing
the attributes of the saint to herself in her
own harsh <span class='it'>patois</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl interrupted her ruthlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What an enormous train!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy pointed to the long line of cars crawling
up to the station beside the church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Long train. Many cars,” she explained
slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dame Gagnier’s eyes followed the pointing
finger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It is a pilgrimage,” she answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl scrambled to her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really? A pilgrimage! I thought it was
too late in the season. Do you suppose there
will be a miracle?” she questioned eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the wide hat, the eyes lighted and
the wrinkled lips puckered into a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mam’selle does not believe in those miracle,”
Madame Gagnier reminded her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s shoulders shaped themselves into
an American travesty of the inimitable French
shrug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am always open to conviction,” she announced
calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going to see for myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mam’selle will go to church?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; that is, if you are sure it is a pilgrimage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What else?” In her turn, Madame Gagnier
pointed to the train whence a stream of
humanity was pouring into the square courtyard
of the Basilica.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are sure? I don’t want to break my
neck for nothing, scrambling down your ancestral
driveway.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eh?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the thousandth time during the past
nine days, Nancy felt an unreasoning rage
against the deliberate monosyllable that checked
her whimsical talk. In time, it becomes annoying
to be obliged to explain all one’s figures
of speech. Abruptly she pulled herself up
and began again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Unless you are sure it is a pilgrimage, I
do not wish to walk down the steep slope,” she
amended.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It is a pilgrimage from Lake Saint
John. My son told me. It is the last pilgrimage
of the year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy clasped her hands in rapture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Glory be!” she breathed fervently. “I
am in great luck, to-day, for they said that it
was too late in the year to expect any more of
them. The Good Sainte Anne is working in
my behalf. Now, if she will only produce a
miracle, I’ll be quite content. Good by,
Madame Gagnier!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Madame Gagnier nodded, as she looked after
the alert, erect figure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mam’selle does not believe in those miracle,”
she said calmly. “Well, she shall see.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl stooped to pick up her letters.
Then swiftly she crossed the lawn and entered
the house. Outside a closed door, she paused
and tapped softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in.” The answering voice was impersonal,
abstracted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pushing open the door, Nancy entered
the little sitting-room and crossed to the
desk by the sunny window looking out on
the river.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy dear, are you going to come with
me, for an hour or two?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The figure before the desk lost its scholarly
abstraction and came back to the present.
The student of antiquity had changed to the
adoring father of a most modern sort of American
girl; and his eyes, leaving the musty
ecclesiastical records, brightened with a wholly
worldly pride in his pretty daughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pilgrimage. A great, big pilgrimage,
the last one of the year,” she said eagerly.
“I’m going down to see it. Surely you’ll
go, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, do,” she urged. “You ought to see
it, as a matter of history. It is worth more
than tons of old records, this seeing middle-age
miracles happening in these prosy modern
days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré isn’t Lourdes,
Nancy,” he cautioned her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but the guide-books say it is only
second to Lourdes,” she answered undauntedly.
“Anyway, I want to see what is happening.
Won’t you come, really, daddy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes twinkled, as they looked up into
her animated face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nancy, I am sixty-five years old, and that
trail up the hill is worse than the Matterhorn.
If you follow the zigzags, you walk ten miles
in order to accomplish one hundred feet; if
you strike out across country, you have to
wriggle up on all fours. I know, for I have
tried it. It isn’t a seemly thing for a man of
my years to come crawling home, flat on his
stomach.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed, as she stood drumming idly on
the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry. It is so much more fun to
have somebody to play with. Still, I shall go,
even if I must go alone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started towards the door; then turned
to face him, as he added hastily,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, if you see Père Félicien, ask him
when I can examine those last records by
Monseigneur Laval. I shall be here, tell him,
about ten days longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s face fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten mortal days! Oh, daddy!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I shall need as much time as that. I
prefer to finish up my work here, before I go
on to Quebec.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how long do you mean to stay in
Quebec?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The minor cadence in her tone escaped her
father’s ears. He patted the papers before
him caressingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is impossible to tell. Four or five
weeks, I should say. That ought to give me
time to gather my materials.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy loved her gay home life; but she
also loved her father. She tossed him a kiss
as she left the room; nevertheless, the smile
that accompanied the kiss was rather forlorn
and wavering. Once outside the door, however,
she freed her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten more days here, and a month in that
hole of a Quebec! It will be Thanksgiving,
before we get home. Think of all the fun I
shall be losing!” She pinned on her hat with
a series of energetic pries and pushes. Then
she added fervently, “Oh, Good Sainte Anne,
do get up the greatest miracle of all, and produce
something or somebody that shall add a
little variety to my existence! I’ll give fifty
cents to the souls in purgatory, if you’ll only
be good enough to rescue my soul from this
absolute boredom of boredoms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Surely, never was more unorthodox prayer
directed upward from any shrine. However,
the Good Sainte Anne chanced to be in a propitious
mood, that day.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWO</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Cecil Barth was unfeignedly
low in his mind, that morning. The
causes were various and sundry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First of all, Quebec was a bore. In the
second place, the only people to whom he had
brought letters of introduction had most inconsiderately
migrated to Vancouver, and, fresh
from his English university, he was facing the
prospect of a solitary winter before he could go
out into ranch life in the spring. A Britisher
of sorts, it had not appeared to him to be
necessary to inform himself in advance regarding
the conditions, climatic and social, of the
new country to which he was going. Now,
too late, he recognized his mistake. A third
grievance lay in the non-arrival of the English
mail, that morning; and the fourth and most
fatal of all lurked in the kindly efforts of his
table companion to draw him into the conversation.
To his mind, there was no reason that
the swarthy, black-browed little Frenchman
at his elbow should offer him any comments
upon the state of the weather. The Frenchman
had promptly retired from the talk; but
his dark eyes had lighted mirthfully, as they
had met the asphalt-like stare of his neighbor’s
eyeglasses. Adolphe St. Jacques possessed his
own fair share of a sense of humor; and Cecil
Barth was a new element in his experience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur has swallowed something stiff
that does not agree with him,” he observed
blandly to his fellow student across the table;
and Barth, whose French was of Paris, not of
Canada, was totally at a loss to account for
their merriment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the past week, the group of students
and the chatter of their Canadian <span class='it'>patois</span> had
been anathema to him. He understood not a
word of their talk, and consequently, with the
extreme sensitiveness which too often accompanies
extreme egotism, he imagined that it
related solely to himself. In vain he tried to
avoid their hours for meals. Rising betimes,
he met them at the hurried early breakfast
which betokened an eight o’clock lecture. The
next morning, dreary loitering in his room only
brought him into the midst of the deliberate
meal which was the joyous prerogative of their
more leisurely days. Barth liked The Maple
Leaf absolutely; but he hated the students of
his own table with a cordial and perfect hatred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dropped from the Allan Line steamer, one
bright September morning, as a matter of
course he had been driven up through the
gray old town to the Chateau Frontenac. A
week at the Chateau had been quite enough
for him. To his mind, its luxurious rooms had
been altogether too American. Too American,
also, were its inhabitants. He shrank from the
obvious brides in their new tailor gowns and
their evident absorption in their companions.
He resented those others who, more elderly or
more detached, roused themselves from their
absorption to bestow a friendly word on the
solitary young Englishman. Their clothes,
their accent, and, worst of all, their manners
betrayed their alien birth. No self-respecting
woman, bride or no bride, ever wore such
dainty shoes. No man of education ever
stigmatized an innocent babe as <span class='it'>cunning</span>. And
there was no, absolutely no, excuse for the
familiar greetings bestowed upon himself by
complete strangers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Americans!” quoth Mr. Cecil Barth.
“Oh, rather!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, next morning, he went in search of
another hostelry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found it at The Maple Leaf, just across
the Place d’Armes. Fate denied to him the
privilege of sleeping in the quaint little <span class='it'>pension</span>
whose roof was sanctified by having once sheltered
his compatriot, Dickens; he could only
take his meals there, and hunt for a room
outside. At noon, he came to dinner, too exhausted
by his fruitless search to care whether
or not the students were at the table, or on it,
or even under it. Go back to the Chateau he
would not; but he began to fear lest the only
alternative lay in a tent pitched on the terrace
in the lee of the Citadel and, in that wilderness,
he questioned whether anything so modern as
a tent could be bought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After dinner, the Lady of The Maple Leaf
took his affairs in hand. She possessed the
two essentials, a kindly heart and a sense of
humor. She had seen stray Britishers before;
she had a keen perception of the artistic fitness
of things and, by twilight, Mr. Cecil Barth was
sitting impotently upon his boxes in the third-floor
front room of the town house of the
Duke of Kent. He had very little notion of
the way to proceed about unpacking himself.
Nevertheless, as he put on his glasses and
stared at the panelled shutters of his ducal
casement, he felt more at peace with the world
than he had done for two long weeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In after years, he never saw fit to divulge
the details of his unpacking. It accomplished
itself chiefly by the simple method of his
tossing out on the floor whatever things lay
above any desired object, of leaving those
things on the floor until he became weary of
tangling his feet in them, then of stowing them
away in any convenient corner that offered
itself. By this simple method, however, he
had contrived to gain space enough to permit
of his tramping up and down the floor, and it
was there that he had been taking petulant
exercise, that bright October morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last he halted at the window and stood
looking down into the street beneath. The
Duke of Kent’s house has the distinction, rare
in Saint Louis Street, of standing well back
within its own grounds, and, from his window,
Barth could watch the leisurely procession
passing to and fro on the wooden sidewalks
which separated the gray stone buildings from
the paler gray stripe of asphalt between.
Even at that early hour, it was a variegated
procession. Tailor-made girls mingled with
black-gowned nuns, soldiers from the Citadel,
swaggering jauntily along, jostled a brown-cowled
Franciscan friar or a portly citizen with
his omnipresent umbrella, while now and then
Barth caught sight of a scarlet-barred khaki
uniform, or of the white serge robe and dove-colored
cloak of a sister from the new convent
out on the Grand Allée.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth had travelled before; he had seen
many cities; nevertheless, he acknowledged
the charm of this varied humanity, so long as
it remained safely at his feet. Then he glanced
diagonally across the road to the Montcalm
headquarters, and discovered the patch of sunshine
that lay over its pointed gables.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jolly sort of day!” he observed to himself.
“I believe I’ll try to see something or
other.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a swift forgiveness for the past days of
scurrying clouds, of the woes of moving, even
of students and Americans, he turned away
from the window, caught up his hat, stick and
gloves, and ran lightly down the staircase.
Once out in the street, he strayed past the
English cathedral, past the gray old front of
the Basilica, turned to his left, then turned
again and wandered aimlessly down Palace
Hill. Ten minutes later, he stopped beside
an electric train and watched the crowd scrambling
into its cars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré,” he read from
the label in a rear window. “What can be the
attraction there? Oh, I know; it’s that American
Lourdes place. How awfully American
to go to its miracles by electricity! I believe
I’ll go, too. It might be rather interesting to
see what an American miracle is like.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ticket in hand, he boarded the train, already
moving out of the station. He had some difficulty
in finding a seat to his liking, since a
man of finical habits objects to having two
bundle-laden habitants in the same seat with
himself. However, by the time he was sliding
along under the bluff at Beauport, with the Saint
Lawrence glistening on his right, he decided
that the morning was ideal for a country ride.
By the time the train halted opposite the Falls
of Montmorency, he had forgotten the ubiquitous
students at his table, and, as he entered
into the fertile valley of L’Ange Gardien, he
came to the conclusion that chance had led
him wisely. Just how wisely, as yet he was in
ignorance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was still long before midday when the
train drew up at Sainte Anne station, and
Barth stepped out upon the platform. Then
in amazement he halted to look about him.
Close at hand, an arched gateway led into a
broad square garden, bounded by gravel walks
and bordered on two sides by a row of little
shrines, aged and weatherbeaten. On the third
side stood the church of the Good Sainte Anne,
its twin gray towers rising sharply against the
blue October sky and flanking the gilded
statue of the saint poised on the point of the
middle roof. Around the four sides of the
courtyard there slowly filed a motley procession
of humanity, here a cripple, there one
racked by some mental agony, the sick in
mind and body, simple-hearted and trusting,
each bringing his secret grief to lay at the feet
of the Good Sainte Anne. Mass was already
over, and the procession had formed again to
march to the shrine and to the holy altar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth’s eyes roved over the shabby procession,
over the faces, dull and heavy, or alert
with trust; then he turned to the rose-arched
figure borne on the shoulders of the chanting
priests, and his blood throbbed in his veins,
as he listened to their rich, sonorous voices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A pilgrimage!” he ejaculated to himself.
“And now for a miracle! May the saint be
propitious, for once in a way!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following hard on the heels of the crowd,
he pushed his way through one of the wide
doors, gave a disdainful glance at the huge
racks of crutches and braces left by long generations
of pious pilgrims, looked up at the
vaulted roof, forward to the huge statue of
Sainte Anne half-way up the middle aisle, and
drew a deep breath of content. The next
minute, he choked, as the stifling atmosphere
of the place swept into his throat and nostrils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, by George!” said Mr. Cecil Barth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, once there, he resolved to see the
spectacle to the end. Furthermore, Barth was
artist to the core of his being, and those sonorous
voices, now ringing down from the organ
loft above, could atone for much stale air. A
step at a time, he edged forward cautiously and
took his place not far from the altar rail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The students of his table would have found
it hard to recognize the haughty young Englishman
in the man who knelt there, looking
with pitiful eyes at the forlorn stream of
humanity that flowed past him. Was it all
worth while: the weary fastings and masses,
the scrimping of tiny incomes for the sake
of the journey and of the offering at the shrine,
the faith and hope, and the infinite, childlike
trust, all to culminate in the moment of kneeling
at the carved altar rail, of feeling the sacred
relic touched to one’s lips and to the plague-spot
of body or of soul? And then they were
brushed aside with the monotonous brushing
of the relic across the folded napkin in the left
hand of the priest. For better or worse, the
pilgrimage was over. It was the turn of the
next man. Brushed aside, he rose from his
knees to give place to the next, and yet the
next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just once the monotony was broken. A
worn pair of crutches dropped at the feet of
the statue; a worn old man, white to his lips,
staggered forward, knelt and received the healing
touch on lip and thigh and knee. Then,
with every nerve tense, he struggled to his feet
and made his toilsome way to the outer world,
while the priests recorded one more miracle
wrought by the Good Sainte Anne. Then
the monotony fell again, and became seemingly
interminable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length Barth could endure it no longer.
Rising impatiently, he forced his way down
the crowded aisle and came out into the air
once more. After the dim, dark church and
the choking cloud of the incense, the rush of
sunshiny ozone struck him in the face like a
lash, and involuntarily he raised his head and
squared his shoulders to meet it. He loitered
along the gravel pathway, watching the habitants
who, their pious pilgrimage over, were
opening their crumpled valises and spreading
out their luncheons in the cloisters to the
south of the church. Then, tossing a coin
into the tin cup of the blind beggar in the
gateway, he came out of the court and crossed
the road to the little hillside chapel built of the
seventeenth-century materials of the old church
of Sainte Anne. But the spell of the place
was still upon him; in his mind’s eye, he yet
saw the endless line of pilgrims, bowing and
rising in unbroken succession. With unseeing
gaze, he stared at the rows of carts heaped
with their ecclesiastical trinkets, at the stray
figures lifting themselves heavenward by means
of the Scala Sancta Chapel, and at the line of
white farmhouses poised high on the bluff
beyond. Then, yielding to the spell of the
kneeling figures, of the incense-filled air and
of the chanting voices, he turned and hurried
back again to the church.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time he reached the steps once more,
the procession was flowing swiftly outward,
and the little platform at the doorway was
crowded with excited figures. Barth tried this
door and then that, in a futile endeavor to
regain his old place near the altar rail; but
again and again he was forced backward to the
very verge of the steps. Then an unduly tall
habitant elbowed Barth’s glasses from his nose.
He bent down to pick them up, was jostled
rudely from behind, lost his balance and rolled
down the steps where he landed in a dusty,
ignominious heap in the midst of a knot of
women.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During one swift second, it seemed to Barth
that the vast statue of Sainte Anne had
tumbled from the roof, to dazzle his eyes with
her gilding and to crush his body with her
weight. Then the dancing lights and the
shooting pains ended in darkness and peace.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THREE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Out of darkness and peace, Mr. Cecil
Barth drifted slowly backward to the
consciousness of the glare of the sunshine, of
a babel of foreign tongues and of two points
of physical anguish, centering respectively in a
bruised head and a sprained ankle. He closed
his eyes again; but he was unable to close his
ears. Still too weak to make any effort upon
his own behalf, he wondered vaguely when
those clacking tongues would cease, and their
owners begin to do something for his relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stand out of the way, please. He needs
air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The words were English; the accent unmistakably
American. Barth pinched his lids
together in a sturdy determination not to manifest
any interest in his alien champion. For
that reason, he missed the imperative gesture
which explained the words to the crowd; he
missed the anxious, kindly light in Nancy
Howard’s eyes, as she elbowed her way to his
side and bent down over him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are hurt?” she questioned briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even in this strait, Barth remained true to
his training. He opened his eyes for the
slightest possible glance at the broad black hat
above him. Then he shut them languidly
once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather!” he answered, with equal brevity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The corners of Nancy’s mouth twitched
ominously. It was not thus that her ministrations
were wont to be received. Accustomed
to fulsome gratitude, the absolute indifference
of this stranger both amused and piqued her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are American?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time, Barth’s eyes remained open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“English,” he returned laconically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Nancy’s lips twitched.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon. I might have known,”
she answered, with a feigned contrition whose
irony escaped her companion. “But you
speak French?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not this kind. I shall have to leave it to
you.” In spite of the racking pain in his
ankle, Barth was gaining energy to rebel at
his short sight and the loss of his glasses. It
would have been interesting to get a good look
into the face of this intrepid young woman who
had come to his rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She received his last statement a little blankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t speak any French of any kind,”
she confessed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How unusual!” Barth murmured, with
vague courtesy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy rose from her knees and dusted off
her skirt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why. I’ve never been abroad,
and we don’t habitually speak French at home,”
she answered a little resentfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth made no reply. All the energy he
could spare from bearing the pain of his ankle
was devoted to the study of how he could
get himself out of his present position. His
gravelly resting-place was uncomfortable, and
it appeared to him that his foot was swelling
to most unseemly dimensions. Nevertheless,
he had no intention of throwing himself upon
the mercy of a strange American girl of unknown
years and ancestry. Raising himself on
his elbow, he addressed the bystanders in the
best Parisian French at his command. The
bystanders stared back at him uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Standing beside him, Nancy saw his dilemma,
saw, too, the bluish ring about his lips. Her
amused resentment gave place to pity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid you are badly hurt,” she said
gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My ankle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sprained?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Broken, I am afraid.” Barth’s answers
still were brief; but now it was the brevity of
utter meekness, not of arrogance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I hope not!” she exclaimed. “You
can’t walk at all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gritting his teeth together, Barth struggled
up into a sitting posture.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid not. It was foolish to faint;
but I hit my head as I went down, and the
blow knocked me out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he spoke, he bent forward and tried to
reach the laces of his shoe. With a swift gesture,
Nancy forestalled him and deftly slipped
the shoe from the swollen ankle. Her quick
eye caught the fact that few of her friends at
home could match the quality of the stocking
within. Then her glance roved to his necktie,
and she smiled approvingly to herself. In her
girlish mind, Barth would pass muster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, there was nothing especially
heroic about him, as he sat there on the gravel
with his ankle clasped in his hands and the
color rising and dying in his cheeks. A man
barely above the middle height, spare and
sinewy and without an ounce of extra flesh,
Cecil Barth was in no way remarkable. His
features were good, his hair was tawny yellow,
and his near-sighted eyes were clear and blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where can I find a surgeon?” he asked,
after a little pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know, unless—” Nancy hesitated;
then she added directly, “My father is
a doctor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And speaks English?” he queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy bravely suppressed her laughter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“New York English,” she replied gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Barth answered with perfect good
faith,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That will do. They are not so very different,
and we can understand each other quite
well, I dare say. Where is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl pointed towards the crest of the
bluff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is at the Gagnier farm.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I trouble you to send some one for
him?” Barth asked courteously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She glanced about her at the group of
French faces, and she shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never can make them understand,” she
objected. “I’d better go, myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, in his turn, Barth offered an objection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t go and leave me,” he urged a
little piteously. “I might go off again, you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you just said you couldn’t walk?”
Nancy responded, in some surprise, for, granted
that the stranger was able to remove himself,
she could see no reason whatsoever that he
should not feel free to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. I can’t walk a step. My foot
is broken,” he answered rather testily, as a
fresh twinge ran through his ankle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then how can you go off, I’d like to
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth stared at her uncomprehendingly for
a moment. Then a light broke in upon his
brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I see. You don’t understand. I
meant that I might faint away,” he explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s reply struck him as being a trifle
unsympathetic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, what if you did?” she demanded.
“I can’t be in two places at once, and these
people won’t eat you up. Make up your mind
that you won’t faint, and then you probably
won’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth peered up at her uneasily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you—are you a Christian Scientist?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s laugh rang out gayly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t I say my father was a doctor?” she
reminded him. “Now please do lie still and
save your strength, and I’ll see what I can do
about it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was gone from his side only for a
moment. Then she came flying back, flushed
and eager.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Such luck!” she said. “Right at the foot
of the hill, I found Père Gagnier and the cabbage
cart, just coming home from market. He
will be here in a minute, and he talks French.
Some of these people will carry you to the
cart, and you can be driven right up to the
door. That will take so much less time than
the sending for my father; and, besides, even
if he came down, you couldn’t be left lying
here on the gravel walk for an indefinite period.
You would be arrested for blocking the path
of the pilgrims, to say nothing of having relays
of cripples crutching themselves along over
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her relief at having solved the situation,
she paid no heed to the stream of nonsense
coming from her lips. Barth’s stare recalled
her to self-consciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, really,” he answered stiffly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, daddy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the question, Dr. Howard looked up.
Still a little breathless and dishevelled by her
hurried scramble up the hill, Nancy stood
before him, anxiety in her eyes and a laugh on
her lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How is the British Lion?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most uncommonly disagreeable,” the doctor
answered, with unwonted energy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I found out; but he has occasional
lucid intervals. How is his ankle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Bad. For his own sake, I wish he had
broken it outright. Nancy, what am I going
to do with the fellow?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy dropped down into a chair, and
smoothed her ruffled hair into some semblance
of order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Cure him,” she answered nonchalantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It takes two to make a cure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then hire Père Gagnier to cart him back
to Sainte Anne again, and let her try her finger
upon him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of himself, the doctor laughed.
Then he grew grave again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not altogether funny, Nancy. You
have unloaded a white elephant on my hands,
and I can’t see what to do with it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean?” she questioned, for
she was quick to read the anxiety in her father’s
tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The man speaks no French that these
people here can understand, and he is going
to be helpless for a few days. How is he
going to have proper care?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Send him in to Quebec. There must be
a hospital there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t take the risk of moving him; not
for ten days, at least.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hm!” Nancy’s falling inflection was
thoughtful. “And you came here to get away
from all professional worry. Daddy, it’s a
shame! I ought never to have had him brought
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pausing in his tramp up and down the
room, Dr. Howard rested his hand on the pile
of auburn hair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was all you could do, Nancy. One
must take responsibilities as they come.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy broke the pause that followed. Rising,
she pinned on her hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where are you going?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the station. I’ll telegraph to Quebec
for a nurse. We can have one out here by
night. Good by, daddy; and don’t let the
Lion eat you up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than an hour later, she came toiling
up the hill and dropped wearily down on the
steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No use, daddy! I have exhausted every
chance, and there’s not a nurse to be had.
Quebec appears to be in the throes of an epidemic.
However, I have made up my mind
what to do next.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall turn nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nancy, you can’t!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must. You’re not strong enough, and
such a curiosity as this man mustn’t be left to
die alone. Besides, it will be fun, and Mother
Gagnier will help me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you don’t know anything about nursing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I won’t kill him. You can coach me behind
the scenes, and I shall scramble through,
some way or other. Besides, the Good Sainte
Anne will help me. I’ve just been tipping
her, for the way she has come to my relief.
Only this morning, I promised her half a dollar,
if she would deign to give me a little excitement.”
Then the girl turned still more
directly to her father, and looked up at him
with wayward, mocking, tender eyes. “Daddy
dear, this isn’t the only emergency we have
met, side by side. Mother Gagnier shall do
all the rougher part; the rest you shall leave
to me. Truly, have you ever known me to
fail you at the wrong time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the doctor answered, with perfect truthfulness,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Nancy; I never have.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FOUR</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Out on the end of the long pier that juts
far into the Saint Lawrence, Nancy
Howard was idly tossing scraps of paper into
the choppy surface of the mighty river. Behind
her, Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré was rapidly
putting on her winter guise. The last pilgrimage
ended, the good saint lost no time in
packing up her relics for safe keeping, until
the next year’s pilgrims should turn their faces
towards her shrine. Nancy had returned from
the telegraph office, two days before, past rows
of dismantled booths and of shops whose proprietors
were already taking inventory of their
remaining possessions. The heaped-up missals
and rosaries made little impression upon
her; but even her stalwart Protestantism rebelled
at sight of the bare-armed priestess who
was scrubbing a plaster Virgin with suds and a
nailbrush. Nancy would have preferred the
more impersonal cleansing administered by the
garden hose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even Nancy Howard had been forced to
admit that the Good Sainte Anne had earned
her money. Excitement had not been lacking,
during the past two days. It was one
thing to come to her father’s aid with an offer
to play nurse; it was quite another matter to
give several hours of each day to the whims of
a man who was as unused to pain as he was to
the thwarting of his plans. Nancy had expected
a playful bit of masquerade. She
promptly discovered that she was doomed to
work as she had never worked before. She
had informed Barth that it was her custom to
leave all financial arrangements in the hands of
the doctor. She had no idea what value it
might have pleased her father to set upon her
services. She had a very distinct idea, however,
that, whatever the value, she fully earned
it. Arrogant and desponding, masterful and
peevish by turns, Cecil Barth was no easy
patient. Accustomed all his life to being
served, he now had less notion than ever of
lifting a finger to serve himself. Moreover,
Nancy Howard had a rooted objection to being
smoked at. Her objection was based upon
chivalry, not antipathy to nicotine; nevertheless,
it was active and permanent. She
only regained her lost poise, when she tried
to reduce to systematic orthography the unspellable
accent of her patient, most of all
that prolonged <span class='it'>Oh-er, raahther!</span> which appeared
to represent his superlative degree of
comparison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nurse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth’s voice met her on the threshold, as,
capped with a bit of lawn and covered with an
ample apron from the wardrobe of Madame
Gagnier, she opened the door of the invalid’s
room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you would never come back.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have needed something?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. The room is too warm, and I think
it is time for the rubbing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not for fifteen minutes,” Nancy answered
calmly. “I told you I would be back in
time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But it is so warm here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why didn’t you call Madame Gagnier to
open a window?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because she is so very clumsy. Please
open it now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy repressed a sudden longing to cross
the room on her heels. Barth was sitting up,
that day; but the lines around his lips and the
brilliant patch of scarlet on either cheek betrayed
the fact that the past two days had
worn upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is your foot aching now?” she asked, as
she returned to her seat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, intensely. Do you suppose that doctor
knows how to treat it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s eyes flashed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He ought to,” she answered shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth turned argumentative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is not a question of obligation; it is a
mere matter of training and experience,” he
observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is the best doctor in the city,” Nancy
persisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In Quebec?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; at home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the dozenth time since his catastrophe,
Barth regretted the loss of his glasses. Nancy’s
tone betrayed her irritation. Unable to see her
face distinctly, he was also unable to fathom the
cause of her displeasure. He peered at her
dubiously for a moment; then he dropped
back in his chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very likely,” he agreed languidly. “Now
will you please move the foot-rest a very little
to the right?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Thank you, nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there anything else?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pointed to the table at his elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My pipe, please; and then if you wouldn’t
mind reading aloud for a time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy did mind acutely; but she took up
the book with an outward showing of indifference,
while Barth composed himself to smoke
and doze at his pleasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a long hour, Nancy read on and on.
Now and then she glanced out at the sunshiny
lawn beneath the window; now and then she
looked up at her patient, wondering if he would
never bid her cease. In spite of her rebellion
at her captivity, however, she was forced to
admit that Barth had his redeeming traits.
His faults were of race and training; his virtues
were his own and wholly likable. Moreover,
in all essential points, he was a gentleman
to the very core of his soul and the marrow of
his bones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“‘Still of more moment than all these cures,
are the graces which God has given, and continues
to give every day, through the intercession
of good Sainte Anne, to many a sinner
for conversion to better life.’” Nancy’s quiet
contralto voice died away, and M. Morel’s old
story dropped from her hands. Barth’s eyes
were closed, and she decided that he had
dropped to sleep; but his voice showed her
mistake.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s a queer old story. Do you believe it
all, nurse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden spice of mischief came into Nancy’s
tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and no. I doubt the epilepsy and
paralysis; it remains to be seen about the
conversions to a better life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose one could tell by following up
the cases,” Barth said thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly.” Nancy’s accent was incisive.
“I accept nothing on trust.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth took a prolonged pull at his pipe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it’s not so easy to follow up cases two
hundred and fifty years old,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I’ll content myself with the modern
ones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you suppose there are any modern
ones?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. The priests claim that there are
several new cases, every year.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you can get on the track of them?”
he asked, with a sudden show of interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely. I have my eye on one of them
now,” Nancy responded gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A Sainte Anne miracle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me where it is?” he urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t. It concerns somebody besides
myself,” she replied, with a decision which he
felt it would be useless to question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a prolonged pause. It was Barth
who broke it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange we never heard of the place at
home!” he said reflectively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long since you came here?” Nancy
asked, rather indifferently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two weeks.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you like it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a change. It is a change from the
’Varsity, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which was your university?” she inquired,
less from any interest in the answer than because
she could see that her patient was in an
autobiographical frame of mind, and even her
brief experience of mankind had taught her to
let such moods have their way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Kings, at Cambridge. I was at Eton
before that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What sent you out here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ranching. My brother went in for the
army, and we didn’t care to have two of a
kind in the same family.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might be a little monotonous,” she
assented gravely. “But where is your ranch?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t any yet. I am stopping in
Quebec for the winter, and I shall go out, early
in the spring.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is Quebec a pleasant place?” she asked,
as she crossed the room to the window and
stood looking out at the river beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s rather charming, only I don’t know
anybody there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you get acquainted, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I? I brought some letters; but
the people have moved to Vancouver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but they aren’t the only people in
Quebec.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course not; but I don’t know any of
the others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you can?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How?” Barth queried blankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, talk to them, do the things they do—oh,
just get acquainted; that’s all,” the girl
answered, with some impatience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He raised his brows inquiringly. It was not
the first time that Nancy had been annoyed by
the expression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Talk to people, before you have been introduced
to them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No reason; only it’s not our way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The way we English people do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a Britisher you are!” she said,
with a momentary impatience that led her to
forget her self-imposed rôle as hireling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His lips straightened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. Why not?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Baffled, she attempted another line of
attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you were never introduced to me,” she
told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you talk to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But that is different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How different?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are my nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her color came hotly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wasn’t at first.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Too late she repented her rashness, as Mr.
Cecil Barth made languid answer,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Still, if I remember clearly, it was
you who first spoke to me. Oh,—nurse!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the door banged sharply, and Barth
found himself alone with his ankle and with
his thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is the nurse?” he asked Dr.
Howard, a long hour later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She went out for a walk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Again?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Have you needed her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not exactly; but—” Barth hesitated.
Then, like the honest Englishman he was, he
went straight to the point. “The fact is, doctor,
I am afraid I said something that vexed her. I
didn’t mean to; I really had no idea of annoying
her. I should dislike to hurt her feelings,
for she has been very good to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time in their acquaintance, Dr.
Howard could confess to a liking for his
patient. Nevertheless, he only nodded curtly,
as he said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You couldn’t have had a better or more
loyal nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to her custom, Nancy remained
on duty, that evening, until nine o’clock.
Then she moved softly up and down, setting
the room in order for the night. Barth had
been lying quiet, staring idly up at the
mammoth shadow of Madame Gagnier, rocking
to and fro just outside the door. Then,
as Nancy paused beside him, he turned to
face her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can I do anything more, sir?” she asked,
with the gentle seriousness which marked her
moods now and then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing, thank you. I am quite comfortable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad. I hope you may have a quiet
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. I hope I may. You have
been very good to me, nurse, and—” his
speech hurried itself a little; “I appreciate it.
As I understand, your wa—salary is paid
through the doctor; but perhaps some little
thing that—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His gesture was too swift and sure to be
avoided. The next instant, Nancy Howard
found herself stalking out of the room with
blazing cheeks and with a shining golden
guinea clasped in the hot palm of her left
hand.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FIVE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>At her window looking out upon the Ring
in the ancient Place d’Armes and upon
the Chateau beyond, Nancy Howard stood
idly drumming on the pane. Under its gray
October sky, the gray-walled city of Quebec
had appeared most alluring to her, that morning;
but she had turned her back upon its
invitation and had resolutely busied herself in
settling her own possessions and those of her
father in the rooms which had been waiting for
them at The Maple Leaf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy had left Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré with
scant regret, the night before. She had spent
numberless interesting hours in the society of
Mr. Cecil Barth. He had piqued her, antagonized
her and occasionally had even compelled
her to like him in spite of herself. However,
the whole episode had been forced upon her.
Now that it was ended, she was glad to dismiss
it entirely into the past, and she had not
thought it necessary to inform Barth that she
too expected to pass some weeks in Quebec.
There was scant chance of their meeting again,
and Nancy had imagined that she had parted
from him without regret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his side, Barth had been at no pains to
conceal his regrets. As Dr. Howard had reminded
him, Nancy had been a most loyal
nurse; and the young Englishman took it
quite as a matter of course that his attendant
should be a girl of brains and breeding as well.
He had heard much of the American college
girl, and he promptly pigeonholed Nancy with
others of that class, although in fact she had
been educated by her father and polished by a
year or so spent at a famous old school on the
Hudson. Barth admired Nancy’s brains, her
common sense and her alert deftness. To his
mind, these qualities in part atoned for her
independence and her hot-headed Americanism;
but only in part. Her society was often
restful, but never cloying; and Barth, now
able to hobble about his room, peered mournfully
out of his window after his departing
nurse with feelings akin to those of a youngster
suddenly deprived of his best mechanical toy.
Bereft of his nurse, he took to his pipe, smoked
himself into lethargy, and emerged from his
lethargy so cross that Madame Gagnier, lumbering
into the room to settle him for the
night, fled from his presence with her cap awry
and her checked pinafore pressed to her aged
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dusk had fallen, when Nancy and her father
drove up the steep slope of Palace Hill, passed
the Basilica and stopped at the low yellow door
of The Maple Leaf. Of the city Nancy saw
but little. Of The Maple Leaf, glaring with
electric lights, she saw much and, even at the
first glance, she assured herself that that much
was wholly to her liking. It was not alone the
curved ceiling of the entrance hallway, nor the
cheery little dining-room where the four tables
and the huge mahogany sideboard struggled
not to elbow each other in their close quarters;
nor yet the deep window-seats of the rooms
with their French casements and their panelled
shutters. It was the nameless flavor of the
place, pervading all things and beautifying all
things, the flavor of nothing in the world but
of old Quebec. The Chateau might exist anywhere;
The Maple Leaf could have existed
nowhere outside of the ancient city wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you love it, daddy?” Nancy urged
for the third time, as they came up from their
late supper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It seems very central,” the doctor assented
tranquilly. “Of course, it is a great advantage
for me to be so near Laval. I only hope you
won’t be lonely here, Nancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed scornfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lonely! After Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré!”
she protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The town is often a good deal more lonely
than the country,” he assured her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nancy, whose eyes had not been entirely
busy with the furniture of the dining-room,
shook her head. Then she went into
her own room, to fall asleep and, quite as a
matter of course, to dream that Mr. Cecil
Barth, Union Jack in hand, was chasing her
around and around the little fountain she could
hear plashing down in the Ring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All the next morning, Nancy was busy in
their two adjoining rooms, hanging up her
gowns and trying to devise an arrangement
which should keep her father’s shirts from too
close connection with his bottle of ink. Now
and then she halted beside his windows which
looked down on a gray-walled courtyard where
an aged habitant sat on a chopping-block and
peeled potatoes without end. Occasionally
she wandered back to her own room, and stood
gazing out at the Champlain statue by the
northern end of the terrace and at the pointed
copper roofs of the huge Chateau. Then she
went on brushing her father’s clothes, and sorting
out her own tangle of gloves and belts and
the kindred trifles that add a touch of chaos to
even the most orderly of trunks. At last,
her work done, she smoothed her hair, tweaked
her gown into position and, without a glance
into the long mirror of her wardrobe, she ran
down to the dining-room in search of her
father.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She found him the sole occupant of a table
near the door, and the other tables were absolutely
deserted. As she went back to her room,
Nancy was forced to admit that the meal had
been a bit dull. A father and daughter who
have been constant companions for years, are
unable to produce an unfailing stream of brilliant
table talk; and Dr. Howard, tired with
the effort of getting his bearings in a strange
library, was even more taciturn than was his
wont. Accordingly, it was in a mood dangerously
akin to homesickness that Nancy left
the empty dining-room and returned to her
equally empty bedroom. Once inside the
door, she made the mortifying discovery that
her lashes were wet; and, with a swift realization
of the ignominy of her mood, she caught
up her hat and coat, and started out to explore
the city on her own account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she dressed herself for supper, two nights
later, Nancy confessed to herself that the past
two days were the dreariest days she had ever
spent. Totally engrossed in his historical
research, her father spent his daytime hours in
poring over the manuscripts in Laval library,
his evening in rearranging and copying his
hurried notes. Left entirely to herself, Nancy
discovered the truth of his words, that a town
could be far more lonely than the country.
At Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré, every one had
had a word of greeting for the bright-faced
American girl; here it seemed to her that she
had no more personality than one of the pawns
on a chessboard. She walked the streets by
the hour at a time, straying at random from
church to church, loitering on the terrace, or
tramping swiftly out the Grand Allée far past
the Franciscan convent and the tollgate beyond.
The tourist season was almost ended. A few
honeymoon couples were still straying blissfully
about the ramparts; but, for the most
part, Quebec had come back from summer
quarters on lake and river, and was settling
into winter routine. Nancy watched it all with
wide, interested, dissatisfied eyes. The show
delighted her; but, as at all other shows, she
felt the need of some companion whose elbow
she could joggle in moments of extreme
excitement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a part of the show, The Maple Leaf had
gratified her whole artistic sense. Humanly
speaking, she had found it a bit disappointing.
Manœuvre as she would, she could never succeed
in finding the dining-room full. There
seemed to be something utterly inconsequent
in the way in which the boarders took their
meals, now late, now early, and now apparently
not at all. She had been told that there were
forty of them; but, so far as she could discover,
six constituted a quorum, and the meal
was served accordingly. Once only, the entire
quorum had occurred at her own table. Four
fresh-faced elderly Frenchmen had marched
into the room in procession, and had planted
themselves opposite Nancy and her father.
Dr. Howard read French, but spoke it not at
all. Nancy felt that her own three words
would prove inadequate. Accordingly, after
one international deadlock over the possession
of the salt, silence had fallen. When she left
the table, Nancy felt that she had gained a
full perception of the viewpoint of a deaf
mute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was with a spirit of absolute desperation
that Nancy flung open the door of her wardrobe,
that night. Humanity failing, she would take
refuge in clothes. At Sainte Anne, she had
lived chiefly in a short skirt and blouse; at
The Maple Leaf, she had been waiting to
discover the prevailing habits of dress. Now
she told herself that two women at a time
could not make a habit; and, furthermore, she
assured herself that she cared nothing for local
habits anyway. The wardrobe held three new
gowns, obviously of New York manufacture.
Nancy did not hesitate. With unerring instinct,
she chose the most ornate one of the
three, which also chanced to be the one which
was most becoming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And so it came to pass that Reginald Brock,
pausing in the hall to take off his overcoat,
whistled softly to himself as he caught a
glimpse of a pale gown of dusky blue and
a head capped with heavy coils of tawny hair.
The coat slid off in a hurry, Brock gave one
hurried look into the tiny mirror of the rack;
then, his honest Canadian face beaming with
content, he came striding into the dining-room
and dropped into his place at Nancy’s side,
with a friendly nod of greeting.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SIX</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later, Brock followed Nancy
into the parlor. The Lady of The
Maple Leaf was at his side, and Nancy had an
instinctive feeling that they were in search of
her. It was the Lady who spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Brock has just been talking to your
father in the hall,” she said; “and now he
has asked me to give him a ceremonious introduction
to you. As a rule, we aren’t so ceremonious,
here in Canada; but Mr. Brock
insists upon it that the butter-knife and the
mustard are no proper basis for acquaintance.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have learned a thing or two from Johnny
Bull,” the tall Canadian added, as he placed himself
in the window-seat beside Nancy’s chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Johnny Bull?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, an English fellow that has been stopping
here for a few days. Where is he? I
haven’t seen him for a week,” he added, turning
to the Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is ill; I expect him back in a day or
two. Please excuse me. I hear the telephone.”
And she hurried out of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy looked after her regretfully. Even
during the three days she had been there, she
had gained a sound liking for the blithe little
woman, always busy, never hurried, and invariably
at leisure for a friendly word with any
or all of her great family of boarders. Brock’s
glance followed that of Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she is a remarkable woman,” he assented
gravely to her unspoken words. For
an instant, his keen gray eyes met Nancy’s
eyes, steadily, yet with no look of boldness.
Then his tone changed. “But about Johnny
Bull. He is a revelation to the house, the son
of a stiff-backed generation. He was here for
a week, and left us all trying to get his accent
and to imitate his manners.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what became of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Gone. The Lady says he is ill. I hope
we didn’t make him so. Have you been here
long, Miss Howard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three days.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And have you seen anything at all of
Quebec?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, a little. I have been to the Cathedral,
and the Basilica, and the Gray Nunnery, and
the Ursuline Convent, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You appear to be of an ecclesiastical turn
of mind,” Brock suggested, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So does Quebec,” she retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He laughed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I suppose it does to a stranger;
but wait till you have been here a little
longer.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’ll forget that a church exists, except
the one you go to, on Sundays.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed in her turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not unless I grow deaf. The Ursuline
bell begins to ring at four, and the one on the
Basilica at half-past. From that time on until
midnight, the bells never stop for one single
instant. Under such circumstances, how can
one forget that a church exists?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He modified his statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean that you’ll find that Quebec has
its worldly side.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Which side?” she queried. “As far as
I can discover, the city is bounded on the
north by the Gray Nuns, and on the south
by the Franciscan sisters. Moreover, I met
Friar Tuck in the flesh, down in Saint Sauveur,
yesterday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock raised his brows questioningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mean that your explorations have
even extended into Saint Sauveur?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Still, there is hope for me. I
haven’t been to the Citadel yet, and I keep
my guide-book strictly out of sight.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out of mind, too, I hope,” he advised her.
“It holds one error to every two facts, and the
average tourist carries away the impression that
Montgomery was shot in mid-air, like a hawk
above a hen-roost. If you don’t believe me, go
and listen to their comments upon his tablet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where is it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two thirds of the way up Cape Diamond,
above Little Champlain Street. It is labelled
as being the spot where Montgomery fell; but,
as it is two hundred feet above the road, one
can only infer that he came down from somewhere
aloft. Is this your first visit to Quebec,
Miss Howard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I have been in Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré
for three weeks, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any pilgrimages?” Brock inquired, as he
deliberately settled himself in a less tentative
position and crossed his legs. A closer inspection
of Nancy was undermining his vigorous
objection to red hair, and he suddenly determined
that the parlor was a much more attractive
spot than he had been wont to suppose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One; but it was a large one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miracles, too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One and a half,” she responded unexpectedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Meaning?” Brock questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The half miracle was a man who threw
away his crutches and crawled off without
them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the whole one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy laughed again. Then she said demurely,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That the Good Sainte Anne answered my
prayer for a little excitement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was that a miracle?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She answered question with question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever stop at Sainte Anne?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, once for the space of two hours. We
had all the excitement I cared for, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy sat up alertly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it a pilgrimage?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; merely a pig on the track.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nestled back again in the depths of her
chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What anticlimax!” she protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you haven’t told me what form your
own excitement took,” Brock reminded her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was an Englishman.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we’re used to those things,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I pity you,” she said, with an explosiveness
of which she was swift to repent.
“Oh, I beg your pardon,” she added contritely.
“Perhaps you are one of them, yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; merely a Canadian,” Brock reassured
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it the same thing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mocking light came into Brock’s gray
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not always,” he replied quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” Nancy’s tone was thoughtful. “I
am beginning to find it out. Our Englishman
was unique.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ours?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, by adoption. The Good Sainte
Anne and I took him in charge.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With what success?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It remains to be seen. We did our best
for him; but really he was very preposterous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What became of him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. He is there now; at least, he was
there, when we came away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was he working out his novena?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; just mending himself. He fell off
from something, his dignity most likely, and
bumped his head and sprained his ankle. I
happened to be on the spot, and rashly admitted
that my father was a doctor. Then,
before I really had grasped the situation, the
poor man was bundled into a cart and deposited
at our door, half fainting and wholly
out of temper.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then we couldn’t get a nurse for love
or money, and I had to go to work and take
care of him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Happy man!” Brock observed. “I only
hope he appreciated his luck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The corners of Nancy’s mouth curved upwards,
and a malicious light came into her
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think he did. He not only expressed
himself as pleased with my services; but, on
one occasion, he gave me a—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A brand-new guinea.” And Nancy’s
laugh rang out so infectiously that Brock
would have joined in it, if she had been discussing
the foibles of himself rather than of
the unknown Englishman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How exactly like our Johnny Bull!” he
commented, when he found his voice once
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Nancy’s puritan conscience asserted
itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truly, I ought not to laugh about him,
Mr. Brock. He had no idea that I was anything
but a servant, and he thought he had
every reason to tip me. He wasn’t bad, only
very funny. He really knew a great deal
and, according to his notions, he was a most
perfect gentleman. It was only that our
notions clashed sometimes. Yes, daddy,
I am coming. Good night, Mr. Brock.”
And she left him staring rather wishfully
after the disappearing train of her dull blue
gown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be confessed that Brock dawdled
over his breakfast, the next morning; but his
dawdling was quite in vain. Nancy had taken
her own breakfast long before he appeared,
and, by the time Brock had reached his second
cup of coffee, she was walking rapidly along
the terrace towards the Citadel. At the end,
she paused for a moment of indecision.
Then, with a glance up at the Union Jack
above her head, she slowly mounted the long
flight of steps and came out on the narrow
upper terrace which skirts the outer wall of the
fortress. There she paused again and stood,
her arms folded on the railing, looking down
on the picture at her feet. She had been there
once before; to-day, however, the impression
was keener, more enjoyable. The change
might have come from the sunshine that lay
in yellow splashes over the city beneath; it
might have come in part from the memory of
her idle talk with Brock, the night before.
In all that town of antiquity and of strangers,
it had been good to meet some one whose age
and viewpoint corresponded to her own. The
direct gaze of Brock’s clear eyes had pleased
Nancy. She had liked his voice, and the
unconscious ease with which he carried his
seventy-three inches of height. Too outward
seeming, his type was as unfamiliar as that of
the Englishman, and Nancy liked it vastly
better. With Barth, she had been standing
on tiptoe, psychologically speaking. With
Brock, she could be her every-day, normal
self.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been at Brock’s suggestion that she
had gone to the upper terrace, that morning;
and she shook off the memory of his gray eyes
in order to recall the dozen sentences with
which he had characterized the salient points
of the view beneath. Then she gave up the
attempt. In the face of all that beauty, it was
impossible to fix one’s mind upon mere questions
of geography. At her left, the city sloped
down to Saint Roch and the Charles River
beyond, and beyond that again was the long
white village of Beauport straggling along the
bluff above the river. At her right, quarter
of a mile beyond the Citadel, were the ruined
hillocks of the old French fortifications; and,
on the opposite shore, the town of Lévis was
crested with its trio of forts and dotted with
tapering spires of gray. From one of the piers
below, a little steamer was swinging out into
midstream and heading towards the point where
Sillery church overlooks the valley; and, close
against the base of the cliff, the irregular roofs
of Champlain Street lay huddled in a long line
of shadow. The river was shadowy, too; but
above the city a rift in the clouds sent the
strong sun pouring down over the guns on the
eastern ramparts, over the southern tower of
the Basilica and over the spires of Laval. As
she looked, Nancy drew a long breath of sheer
delight and, all at once and for no assignable
cause, she decided that she was glad she
had come. Then abruptly she turned her
back upon a tall figure crossing Dufferin
Terrace, and walked swiftly away past Cape
Diamond and came out on the Cove Fields
beyond.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When she came in to dinner, she was flushed
and animated. As Brock had predicted, she
had discovered that Quebec’s interest did not
centre wholly in its churches. True, there had
been a certain disillusion in finding a portly
Englishman playing golf with himself upon
the ground over which the French troops had
marched out to face the invading, conquering foe,
in seeing a Martello Tower begirt with clothes-lines
and flapping garments, and in discovering
a brand-new rifle factory risen up, Phœnix-like,
from the ashes of the old-time battleground.
The impression was blurred a little; nevertheless,
it was there, and Nancy, as her feet wandered
up and down the trail of the armies upon
that thirteenth of September of the brave year
’Fifty-nine, took a curious satisfaction in the
fact that Wolfe, too, had been banned with a
head of red hair. Her own ancestors were English.
Perhaps some of their kin had landed at
Sillery Cove, to scale the cliff and die like gentlemen
upon the Plains of Abraham. Her
blood flowed more quickly at the thought. In
Nancy’s mind, this was the hour of England.
She even forgot the shining golden guinea that
reposed among her extra hairpins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy came into the house to find the Lady
packing a dinner into an elaborate system of
pails and cosies. The Lady looked up with a
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Our invalid has come back again,” she
explained; “and I am sending his dinner over
to his room.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SEVEN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Brock inquired, three days
later; “have you been doing ecclesiastics
again, to-day?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy, glancing up from her soup, registered
the impression that Brock supported an
extremely good tailor, and that his Sabbath
raiment was becoming to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. You told me that this was the proper
day for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where did you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the Basilica, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“True to the tradition of the tourist. By
the way, that’s rather a good alliteration. I
think I’ll use it again sometime.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy disregarded his rhetorical outburst
and pinned her attention to the fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do they always go there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, to start with. Of course, you didn’t
stop there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I did. Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard, you have neglected your
opportunities. The regular tourist itinerary
begins with the Basilica at ten, sneaks out and
goes over to the English Cathedral at eleven
and follows on the tail of the band when it
escorts the soldiers home to the Citadel. Then
it takes in the Ursuline Chapel at two, stops
to drop a tear over Montcalm’s skull and then
skurries off, on the chance of getting in an
extra service before five-o’clock Benedictions
at the Franciscan Convent.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The white chapel with the pale green
pillars?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, out on the Grand Allée.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve been there,” she assented. “I love
the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then,” Brock continued inexorably;
“if you make good time over your supper,
you can just get back to the Basilica at
seven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t need to do all that,” she objected.
“There are more Sundays coming.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That makes no difference. Every stranger
is bound to gallop through his first Sunday in
Quebec. It is one of the duties of the place.
You think you won’t do it; but, at two
o’clock, you’ll have an uneasy consciousness
that those cloistered nuns over at the Ursuline
may do something or other worth seeing. By
quarter past two, you’ll be buried in a haze of
mediævalism and incense.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never!” she protested, with what proved
to be strict adherence to truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what about the Basilica?” Brock
asked her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Superb!” Nancy’s eyes lighted. “I was
there, a few days ago. It was empty, and it
didn’t impress me in the least. It seemed to
me a dead weight of white enamel paint and
gold leaf, so heavy that it wasn’t even cheerful.
But to-day—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-day?” he echoed interrogatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nancy made an unexpected digression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Brock, what is that huge pinky-purple
Tam O’Shanter dangling above the
chancel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard, where was your bump of
reverence, and where were your guide-books?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My bump of reverence was fastened down
with hatpins, and my guide-books are buried
in the bottom of my trunk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since when?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Since I made the discovery that Quebec
must be inhaled, not analyzed,” she responded
promptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock laid down his knife and fork, and
patted his hands together in mock applause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A subtle distinction. Might I ask whether
it applies to the incense?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy made a wry face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Incense should be a symbol, not a
fact. It is destructive to all my devotional
spirit. Still, even in this one week, I have
become an epicure in it. Granted that the
wind is in the right direction, I can recognize
the brand at least a block away. I like the
kind they use at the Basilica best. That out
at the Franciscan Convent is doubtless choice;
but it is a bit too pungent for my Protestant
nose.” Then of a sudden her face grew grave.
“Please don’t think I am making fun of serious
matters, Mr. Brock,” she added. “Even
if I do dislike the incense, I can appreciate the
beauty of the service, and I should be ashamed
of myself, if I couldn’t be really and truly
reverent in the midst of all that dignified
worship.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock was no Catholic; he possessed the
average devoutness of his age and epoch.
Nevertheless, he liked Nancy’s swift change of
mood. All in all, he liked Nancy extremely,
and he was sincerely grateful to the fate which
had given him this attractive table companion.
The past three days had brought them into
an excellent understanding and friendship.
Trained in totally different lines, they yet had
many a point in common. They were equally
direct, equally frank, equally blest with the
saving sense of humor. In spite of the dainty
femininity of all her belongings, Nancy met
Brock with the unconscious simplicity of a
growing boy. The manner was new to Brock,
and he found it altogether pleasing. Most
of the women he had met, had contrived to
impress upon him that he was expected to flirt
with them. It was obvious that Nancy Howard
wished either to be liked for herself, or to be
let alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you enjoyed yourself?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s mind went swiftly backward over
the morning. Impressionable and artistic of
temperament, she could yet feel the thrill which
accompanies the worship of close-packed, kneeling
humanity, still hear the chanting of the
huge antiphonal choirs, the throng of priests
in the chancel answered by the green-sashed
seminarians in the organ loft above. The gorgeous
robes of the celebrants, the ascetic face
of the young preacher, and even the motley
crowd who, too poor to hire seats in a church
of such wealth and fashion, knelt in a huddled
mass of humanity upon the bare pavement just
within the nave: all these were details; but
they helped to fill in a picture of absolute
devotion and faith. Nancy raised her eyes to
Brock’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would be willing to pray with a rosary,
all my days,” she said impulsively; “if it would
give me the look of some of those people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment, Brock felt, the look was
hers. Then she laughed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Still, I shall always have one regret. Why
didn’t you tell me how to make a procession
of myself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About the gorgeous man that ushers
one in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know there was one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Brock!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you ought to.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I don’t go to the Basilica.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not always, of course; but surely sometimes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was never inside the doors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I met,” Nancy observed reflectively; “a
New York man, last summer, who had never
set eyes on the Washington Arch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, the two cases seem to me to be
about parallel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock reddened. Nevertheless, it was impossible
to take offence at Nancy’s downright
tone and, the color still in his cheeks, he
laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may as well plead guilty. But who is
the man?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The New Yorker?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; the Basilica.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is he, you’d better say. He appears
to be a mixture of an usher, a tithingman
and a glorious personification of the
Church Militant. He is at least six feet tall,
and he wears a long blue coat with scarlet
facings and yards of gold lace. That would
be impressive enough; but he gains an added
bit of dignity by perambulating himself up the
aisles with a tall, gold-headed sceptre in his
hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he also perambulate you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s head moved to and fro in sorrowful
negation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; nobody told me about him, and I
lost my chance. I was so disappointed, too.
One doesn’t get a chance, every day in the
week, to be converted into a whole triumphal
procession with an ecclesiastical drum-major at
its head.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Most likely it is only a Sunday luxury
there,” Brock suggested dryly. “But what
did you do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s face lengthened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I disgraced myself,” she confessed. “But
how could I know the customs of the country?
I went in good season, and I stood back,
meekly waiting for an usher, until the whole
open space around me was full of men, kneeling
on handkerchiefs and newspapers and even
on their soft hats. I began to feel like a
Tower of Babel set out in the middle of a
village of huts. I know I never was half so
tall before. And still no usher came. At
last, I couldn’t bear it any longer, and I
sneaked into an empty pew, half-way up the
aisle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh; but it wasn’t at all the right thing to
do. I was barely seated, when I felt a forefinger
poke itself into my shoulder. I looked
around, and there stood a woman in crape,
frowning at me as if I were a naughty child.
She whispered something to me. It sounded
very stern; but I couldn’t understand what it
was about, so I just smiled at her and started
to move in. But she poked me again, quite
viciously, that time, and pointed out into the
aisle. Then I understood her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And obeyed?” Brock asked, laughing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What else could I do? She was taller
than I.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the Good Samaritan appeared.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The gold-laced one?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; nothing so impressive. He was a
little Frenchman who came out of his pew
farther down the aisle, and in the nicest possible
English asked me to go there with him.
You’ve no idea how merciful he was to me,
nor how I appreciated it. I was beginning to
feel like an outcast, and he saved my self-respect
and returned it to me, unbroken.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock started to answer; but Dr. Howard had
appealed to Nancy for confirmation of one of his
statements. By dint of much effort and at cost
of frequent misunderstandings, the good doctor
had established relations with his neighbor across
the table, and the two men had been toiling
through a prolonged conversation. Concerning
mere matters of theory, each fondly imagined
that he understood the other perfectly.
Confronted with the problem of the ultimate
destination of the sugar-bowl, they lost their
bearings completely, and were forced to supplement
their tongues with the use of their
right forefingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s acquaintance with the row of Frenchmen
was limited to the careful distribution, at
every meal, of exactly two little nods apiece,
one of hail, the other of farewell. Since her
first meeting with Brock, she had been surprised
at the chance which had continually
brought them into the dining-room at the
same hour; and, in her absorption in his
talk, one or other of the Frenchmen was
often half through his deliberate meal before
she remembered to deal out to him his nod
of greeting. She liked them well enough;
but, at the present stage of intercourse, they
seemed to her a good deal like well-bred
automatons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While Nancy talked to her father, Brock
eyed her furtively. She wore a dark green
gown, that noon, and her vivid hair was piled
high in an intricate heap of burnished coils.
Her hands were bare of rings, her whole
costume void of the dangling ornaments which
Brock so keenly detested; but, close in the
hollow of her throat, there blazed one great
opal like a drop of liquid fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So suddenly that he had no time to drop his
eyes to his plate, Nancy turned to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Brock, there is my French Samaritan!”
she exclaimed softly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock glanced up at the figure who was
moving past the table where they sat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That? That is St. Jacques,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A law student, over at Laval, and one
of the best fellows walking the earth at the
present time,” Brock answered, with the swift
enthusiasm which, as Nancy discovered in the
weeks to come, was one of his most striking
characteristics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy rested her elbows on the table, with
a fine disregard of appearances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, he looks it,” she said impressively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s all right.” Brock nodded over his
grapes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And lives here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Eats here; that’s all. The table just
back of you is full of Laval men. They come
in relays, twenty of them for the six seats; and
Johnny Bull sits enthroned among them like a
mute at the funeral feast. St. Jacques sits just
back of your father. I wonder you haven’t
noticed him before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy played aimlessly with her grapes for
a minute or two. Then, turning slightly in
her chair, she looked over her shoulder towards
the next table. As she did so, the man who
sat exactly at her back, moved by some sudden
impulse, turned at the same instant, and Nancy
found herself staring directly into the unrecognizing
eyeglasses of no less a person than Mr.
Cecil Barth.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER EIGHT</h2>

<p class='pindent'>To adopt the vernacular of the stables,
Nancy shied violently, for the apparition
was both unexpected and unwelcome. She
rallied swiftly, however, and, promptly resolving
to make the best of a bad matter, she gave
a little nod and smile of recognition. The
next instant, both nod and smile went sliding
away from the unresponsive countenance of Mr.
Cecil Barth and focussed themselves with an
added touch of cordiality upon M. St. Jacques,
while the young Frenchman bowed low in
surprised pleasure at her friendly greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even in her instantaneous glance, Nancy
saw that Barth looked worn and ill; and, with
unregenerate spite working in her heart, she
told herself that she was glad of it. She had
no idea that, unable to supply himself with
new glasses before his return to the city, Barth
had gained absolutely no conception of the
personal appearance of his quondam nurse.
Moreover, as Nancy had neglected to inform
him in regard to her normal pursuits and her
future plans, he had spent the last week in
regretfully picturing her, still in cap and pinafore,
ministering to the needs of some invalid
Yankee in that vast unknown which he vaguely
termed The States. Accordingly, it came
about that the dinner, that Sunday noon, was
finished in hot rage by Nancy, in joyous anticipation
by Adolphe St. Jacques, and in stolid
unconcern by Mr. Cecil Barth who was aware
neither of the existence of an emotional crisis,
nor of the fact that to him was due any share
of its creation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy sat alone in the parlor, after dinner,
waiting for her father to join her, when Barth
came into the room. He halted on the threshold
long enough to look her over in detail;
then he limped past her and took possession
of the chair beyond her own. As they sat
there silent, elbow to elbow, Nancy was conscious
of a wayward longing to remind him
that it was high time for his liniment. However,
she refrained. Two could play at that
game of stolid disregard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady looked puzzled, as she followed
Barth into the room, a few moments later.
Only a day or two before, Nancy, moved by a
spirit of iniquity, had confided to the Lady the
whole tale of her connection with Barth, and
the Lady, who already adored Nancy and, moreover,
was discerning enough to see the inherent
manliness of Barth, had held her peace. A
charming scene of recognition was bound to
follow Barth’s return to The Maple Leaf.
No hint of a mystery to come should take
from the glamor of that pleasant surprise.
Barth and Nancy both were curiously alone;
both were aliens, meeting upon neutral soil.
Already in her mind’s eye the Lady foresaw
romance and international complications.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With her bodily eye the Lady saw the
elements of her international complications
sitting in close juxtaposition, but with their
backs discreetly turned to an obtuse angle
with each other. She made a swift, but futile,
effort to account for the situation. Then she
gave Nancy a merry nod of comprehension, if
not of understanding, and passed on to speak
to Barth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are better, to-day, I hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope you didn’t feel obliged to come
over to dinner. It was no trouble to send
your meals to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. I was tired of stopping in my
room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look as if you had been having
rather a hard time of it,” the Lady said
kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I never supposed an ankle could be
so painful. Still, I hope it is over now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it doesn’t trouble you to walk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, rather! And, besides, it makes one
such an object, you know, and then people
stare. It won’t be long, though, I dare say,
before I can walk without limping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A naughty impulse seized upon the Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You were at Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré, you
said? And could you get proper care in so
small a place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over the unconscious head of Mr. Cecil
Barth, Nancy shook her fist at the Lady.
Then she fled from the room; but not quickly
enough to lose Barth’s answer,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, so-so; nothing extra, but still quite
tolerable. The doctor was clever; but the
nurse, his daughter, was an American, a good-hearted
sort of girl, but rather rude and
untrained.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that Sunday afternoon, Nancy cherished
her hopes of vengeance. Plan after plan suggested
itself to her fertile brain, was weighed
and found wanting. Planned hostility was
totally inadequate; she would leave everything
to chance. Nevertheless, Nancy tarried long
at her mirror, that night; and she went down
to supper with her head held high and a brilliant
spot of color in either cheek. As she
passed the parlor door, she saw Barth, book in
hand, seated exactly where she had left him,
and she suddenly realized that, rather than
endure the short walk to his room, he had
chosen to spend his afternoon in the dreary
solitude of a public sitting-room. For an instant,
her heart smote her, and her step lagged
a little; then she remembered the guinea, and
recalled Barth’s words, that noon, and her step
quickened once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock followed her back to the parlor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, let the Basilica go, to-night,” he
urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you told me it was a part of my
itinerary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No matter. You haven’t kept up your
round, to-day, anyway. Did you do the Ursulines,
this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I was all ready to go; but something
happened that put me in an unchurchly frame
of mind,” Nancy said vindictively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as well. It makes people suspicious
of your past habits, if you rush too violently
into church-going.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But twice isn’t too violently.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two is too,” he retorted. “Besides, St.
Jacques asked me to ask you if he might be
formally introduced, to-night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s face brightened, and her voice lost
the little sharp edge it had taken on with her
reference to her encounter with Barth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. Both on account of his courtesy
to me, and of your characterization of
him, I shall be delighted to meet him. Where
is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Over in his corner by the window, Barth
glanced up from his book. Voices rarely
made any impression upon him; but something
in Nancy’s tone caught his fancy, reminded
him, too, of an indefinite something
in his past. With calm deliberation, he fumbled
about for the string of his glasses, put
them on and favored Nancy with a second
scrutiny, critical and prolonged. The girl’s
cheeks reddened under his gaze, and instinctively
she turned to Brock for protection; but
Brock had gone in search of his friend. From
across the room, one rose from a group of
women and came to Nancy’s rescue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Barth?” she said interrogatively, in
her pretty broken French. “I think it is
Mr. Cecil Barth; is it not? My friend, Mrs.
Vivian, has written to me about you. I believe
you brought a letter, introducing yourself
to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly, though a little stiffly, Barth rose
to his feet. This acquaintance, at least, could
show its proper credentials.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And have you met Miss Howard?” she
continued, after a moment’s talk. “Miss
Howard, like yourself, is a stranger among us.
Perhaps she will allow me to introduce Mr.
Cecil Barth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Howard appears to be rather a common
name, here in Canada,” Barth observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really? I’ve not met any one else by the
name,” Nancy answered rashly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. It was the name of my nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your—nurse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I don’t mean the nurse who took
care of me when I was a little chap,” Barth
explained elaborately. “I’ve just been ill, you
know, sprained my ankle out here at Sainte
Anne-de-Beaupré and was laid up for two weeks.
My nurse out there was a Miss Howard, Miss
Nancy Howard; but she was an American.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Something in the cadence of the final word
was displeasing to Nancy, and the edge came
back into her voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What a coincidence!” she observed quietly.
“I am an American, myself, Mr. Barth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth’s answer was refreshingly naïve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, really? But nobody would ever think
it, I am sure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was two days before Nancy met Barth
again. From her window, she watched with
pitiless eyes as he hobbled to and from his
meals, and her strategic position enabled her to
avoid the dining-room while he was in it.
Meanwhile, her acquaintance with the Lady
and St. Jacques had made rapid strides and,
together with Brock, omnipresent and always
jovial, they formed a merry group in the tiny
office where the Lady mothered them all by
turns. Nancy shunned the parlor in these
latter days. Dr. Howard was increasingly
absorbed in his studies; and Nancy felt the
increasing need of a duenna, as it dawned upon
her more and more clearly that, wherever she
went, there Brock and St. Jacques were sure to
follow. Nancy looked at life simply; these
healthy-minded boys were only a pair of excellent
playmates. Nevertheless, all things considered,
Nancy preferred to play in the society
of an older person. Furthermore, for long
hours at a time, Mr. Cecil Barth sat enthroned
in the parlor; and, by this time, Nancy was resolved
to avoid Mr. Cecil Barth at any cost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gray October noon was cool and sweet,
two days later, when Nancy came tramping
down the Grand Allée. The exhilaration of
a long walk was upon her, and her step was
as energetic as when she had left The Maple
Leaf, early that morning. Starting at random
by way of the Chien d’Or and the ramparts,
she had skirted the Upper Town and come
out by Saint John’s Gate to the Saint Foye
Road which she had followed until the monument
<span class='it'>Aux Braves</span> was left far behind and the
glimpses of the dark blue Laurentides were
lost in the nearer trees. Then, turning sharply
to the eastward, she came into the Grand
Allée not far from the shady entrance to
Mount Hermon. A glance at her watch assured
her that the morning was nearly over,
and she sped along the interminable plank
sidewalk at a pace which should bring her
back to the tollgate in time for the short
detour to the Wolfe monument. Once in
sight of that inscription, grand in its simple
brevity, Nancy invariably forgot the present,
forgot the gray wall of the jail close by, forgot
even the insistent voices that hailed her from
the cab-stand at the gate. For the moment,
she stood alone in the presence of the past and
of that daring leader whose destiny forbade his
entering the stronghold he had conquered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her breath coming quickly and her lower
lip caught between her teeth, Nancy stood
leaning against the rail, looking out across
the Plains. So absorbed was she in her day-dream
of the past that she paid no heed to a
cab which halted at her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Miss Howard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Starting abruptly, she turned to face Barth.
Tired of his solitary drive, the young fellow’s
eyes were smiling down into the familiar face
as, hat in hand, he bent forward in eager
greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s day-dream vanished like a broken
Prince Rupert’s drop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good morning, Mr. Barth,” she said
grimly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is a jolly sort of morning; isn’t it?
You are paying homage to my countryman?”
he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The allusion was unfortunate. It recalled
his last words to Nancy, and she grew yet
more grim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brave gentlemen belong to no country,”
she answered, with what seemed to her a swift
burst of eloquence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor beggars! Must they all be expatriated?
If that’s the case, it’s better to be
whimpering over a sprained ankle than to die
victorious on the Plains of Abraham.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That wasn’t what I meant at all,” Nancy
interposed hastily. Then she took out her
watch and looked at it a little ostentatiously.
“It is a glorious day, Mr. Barth, and I wish
you a pleasant drive. It is nearly dinner time,
and I must hurry on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not let me take you in?” he urged.
“I am going directly back to The Maple
Leaf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nancy’s answer permitted no argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, no. I am out for the exercise,
and you are going on farther. It is impossible
for me to interfere with your drive.” And,
with a curt bow, she turned away and stalked
off in the direction of the Grand Allée.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The light died out of Barth’s eyes and the
friendly smile fled from his lips, as he realized
that, for the first time in his life, he had
had his overtures rejected. Worst of all, the
rejection was by an American and, from his
point of view, totally without cause. Mr.
Cecil Barth dropped back in his seat, stretched
out his lame foot into a position of comparative
comfort, and then said Things to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He passed Nancy just outside the Saint Louis
Gate. Head up, shoulders thrown back, she
was swinging along with the free step of perfect
health and equally perfect content. From
the solitary dignity of his cab, Barth eyed her
askance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait a bit, though,” he apostrophized her,
with a sudden burst of prophecy. “The time
will come, Miss Howard, when you don’t
rush off and leave me alone like this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nancy, rosy and flushed with exercise,
entered the dining-room, that noon, without a
glance in his direction. Barth kept his own
eyes glued to his plate; but, from over his
right shoulder, he could hear every word of
her merry talk with Reginald Brock. As he
listened, Barth began to question whether England
might not have allowed too great a share
of independence to certain of her western
colonies.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER NINE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy glanced up, as St. Jacques appeared
in the doorway with Brock at his side.
At the farther end of the room, Barth also
glanced up. The action was wholly involuntary,
however, and Barth sought to disguise
with a yawn his ill-timed manifestation of interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look as if you had something of importance
to announce,” Nancy replied, as she
rose and crossed the room to the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So we have. What are you going to do,
this evening?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That isn’t an announcement; it is a question,”
she suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques laughed. Nancy always enjoyed
the sudden lighting of his face. At rest,
it was almost heavy in its dark, intent earnestness;
at a chance word, it could turn mirthful
as the face of a child, gentle with the sympathetic
gentleness of a strong man. Just
now, the rollicking child was uppermost.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How can I tell the difference? I am not
English,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy cocked the white of one eye towards
the far corner of the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither am I,” she said demurely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock’s answer was enigmatic; but Nancy
held the key.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is always possible to be grateful to
Allah,” he said, low, but not so low as to keep
the color from rising in Barth’s cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques turned suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good evening, Mr. Barth. Is your ankle
better?” he queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Barth was as yet unable to make any
distinctions in measuring out his displeasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, Mr. St. Jacques,” he answered
icily. “It is almost quite well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“O—oh. I am very glad,” St. Jacques responded,
in such vague uncertainty as to how
great a degree of gain might be represented
by the <span class='it'>almost quite</span> that he entirely missed
the note of hostility in Barth’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the white of Nancy’s eye moved towards
the corner of the room, as Brock
said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you haven’t answered St. Jacques’s
question, Miss Howard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon. I am not going to do
anything, unless sitting in this room counts for
something.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it doesn’t.” Barth took an unexpected
plunge into the conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what makes you do it?” Brock
inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His intention had been altogether hostile,
for he had been irritated by the discourtesy
shown to his friend. Nevertheless, his irritation
gave place to good-tempered pity, as the
young Englishman answered quietly,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because there’s not so very much left that
I can do. One doesn’t get much variety in a
radius of half a mile a day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time, Nancy turned around.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Doesn’t that ligament grow strong yet?”
she asked, in a wave of sympathy which swept
her off her guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she blushed scarlet, for Barth was
looking up at her in manifest astonishment.
How could this impetuous young woman have
discovered the fact that he owned a ligament?
He had not considered it a fit subject for conversation.
Was there no limit to the unexpected
workings of the American mind?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t know—Oh, it is better,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then in a flash the situation dawned upon
Brock. He recalled Barth’s unexplained illness;
he remembered Nancy’s story of the
Englishman and his golden guinea. Back in
the depths of his sinful brain he stored the
episode, ready to be brought out for use,
whenever the time should be ripe. And
Nancy, looking into those clear gray eyes,
knew that he knew; knew, too, that it would
be useless to beg for mercy for the unsuspecting
Britisher. Moreover, she was not altogether
sure that she wished to beg for
mercy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But really, have you any plan for this
evening?” St. Jacques was urging.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dismissing the others from her mind,
Nancy smiled into the dark face which was
almost on a level with her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That is good. There is a little opera at
the Auditorium, to-night; nothing great, but
rather pretty. I saw it in Saint John, last year.
Brock and I both thought—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What time is it now?” Nancy asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About seven.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy reflected swiftly. Then she said,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Impromptu parties are always the best.
Go and ask the Lady if she can come with us.
If she will—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But only Barth in his corner heard the ending
of her sentence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later, Nancy came rustling
softly down the stairway, her shining hair
framed in the white fur ruff of her cloak.
Two immaculate youths were pacing the hall;
but Barth had disappeared. She found him
sitting in the office beside the Lady. He rose,
as Nancy appeared in the doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t let me keep you,” he said regretfully.
“You are going out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his present mood of content, St. Jacques
felt that he could afford to be gracious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t we look it?” he asked boyishly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Experience had taught Nancy what to expect
when Barth fell to fumbling about the front of
his waistcoat. Nevertheless, even she blushed
at the prolonged stare which was too full of
interest to be impertinent. Then, without a
glance at the others, Barth let the glasses fall
back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, rather!” he answered, with unwonted
fervor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that the best you can say of us, Mr.
Barth?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Rather</span> is Barth’s strongest superlative,”
Brock commented. “Well, are we ready?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady rose with some reluctance. During
the few days of his imprisonment, she had
been brought into closer contact with Barth.
She had watched him keenly, and she had
come to the conclusion that, underneath all his
haughty indifference, the young Englishman
was lonely, homesick and altogether likable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is really too bad to turn you out, Mr.
Barth,” she said kindly. “Won’t you stay
here and read? It is more cosy here, and you
can be quite by yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The friendly words touched Barth and, for
an instant, he lost his poise. A sudden note of
dejection crept into his voice, as he answered,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I seem to accomplish that end, wherever
I go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock was already leading the way to the
door, and Nancy was gathering up her long
skirt. It was St. Jacques who lingered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps you would like to go with us,”
he suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I—” Barth was beginning, when the
Frenchman interrupted,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall be very glad to have you, and I
can easily telephone for another seat. It is
not a great opera; but it will be better than
sitting alone in your room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The unexpected addition to their party was
by no means to Nancy’s liking. Nevertheless,
her eyes rested upon St. Jacques with full
approval. The deed had been a gracious one,
and Nancy felt that, with Brock and St. Jacques
to help her, she could easily manœuvre Barth
to the outer seat beyond the Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The event justified her belief. Barth demurred,
then yielded to a second invitation
which was cordially echoed by the Lady; and
it was at the Lady’s side that he limped down
the aisle. Nancy, in the rear with the others,
told herself that he had no need for his profuse
apologies regarding his dress. Even in
morning clothes, Barth showed that both his
figure and his tailor were irreproachable. She
also told herself that, until then, she had had
no notion of the way the man must have
suffered. It is not without reason that a man
of the early twenties allows himself to hobble
ungracefully into a strange theatre, or gets
white at the lips, by the time he is finally
seated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As St. Jacques had said, the opera was by no
means a great one. However, Nancy, sitting
in that dull green interior, looking about her
at the half-veiled lights and at the dainty gowns,
was absolutely content. Barth, at the farther
end of the row, was talking dutifully to the
Lady, and Nancy had no idea that his position,
bending forward with his hands clasped over
his knee, was taken for the sole purpose of
being able to watch herself. Brock was for
the moment wholly absorbed in a scrutiny of
the audience, and Nancy settled back at her
ease and fell into idle talk with St. Jacques.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Already the young Frenchman was assuming
a prominent place in her thoughts. He was
serious without being dull, merry without being
frivolous; and Nancy rarely found it needful
to explain to him the unexpected workings
of her somewhat inconsequent mind. Even
Brock was sometimes left gasping in the rear.
St. Jacques, although by different and far less
devious paths, was generally waiting to meet
her, when she reached her new viewpoint.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Little by little, she had come to know much
of his history. The strong habitant blood of
two hundred years before had brought forth a
line of sturdy, earnest professional men. True
to their ancestry, they had made no effort to
shake off its customs or its tongue. Highly
educated, first at Laval, then at Paris, they
had gone back to the simple life of their own
people, to give to them the fruits of what,
generations before, had been taken from them.
Because the primeval St. Jacques had wrested
supremacy from his neighbors, there was no
reason that his son’s sons should turn their
backs upon their less fortunate brothers, and
seek wealth and fame in the luxury-loving
cities to the southward. St. Jacques was of
the physical type of the old-time habitant;
but developed far towards the level of all
that is best in manhood. The defensive instincts
of a young girl are not always unreliable.
Nancy trusted Adolphe St. Jacques
implicitly. She was sure that he never stopped
to question how to show himself loyal and
courteous; it came to him quite as a matter
of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you speak English at home?” she
asked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; only French.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you surely have been trained in an
English school,” she persisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The school was like Laval, all French.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet, you speak as we do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His lower lip rolled out into his odd little
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you do, but more slowly. Of course,
I understand; but I think in French, and it
takes a little time to put it into English. But
my English is not like Mr. Barth’s.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor mine,” she assured him merrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But he met her merriment with a curiously
grave face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard, I do not see why I can’t
like that fellow,” he said thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nor I. And yet, he isn’t half bad,”
Nancy replied, with unexpected loyalty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know. He is intelligent, and he means to
be a gentleman,” St. Jacques answered, frowning
gravely as he argued out the position. “I
think I see his good points; but I have nothing
that—that is in common with any of them.
Our worlds are different, and we can never
bring them into connection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the moment, Nancy lost her own gayety
and spoke with a seriousness which matched
his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I understand you. I have felt
it, myself. It is not anything he does consciously,
yet he leaves me feeling that we have
absolutely no common ground. By all rights,
we Americans ought to feel kinship with the
English; but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques turned to face her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But?” he echoed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, Nancy’s eyes were fastened on
her fan, and she answered, with the fearless
honesty of a boy,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But now and then I have felt, since I came
here, that my likeness was entirely to the
French.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And St. Jacques bowed in silence, as the
curtain rose for the final act.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then, there came an unexpected scene
and one not down upon the programme. The
soprano was already in place and the tenor, in
the wings, was preparing to rush in to kneel
at her feet, when the manager came out across
the stage. In the midst of the gaudy costumes,
his black-clothed figure made an instantaneous
impression, an impression which was
heightened by his level voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ladies and gentlemen, I regret to be
obliged to announce to you—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock never knew from what corner of the
upper gallery came that shrill, insistent cry of
fire. When he realized his surroundings,
he was bracing himself against the seat in
front of him, his whole tall figure tense in
the effort to keep Nancy from being crushed
by the mad rush for the doors. Then,
with a bound, the young Frenchman vaulted
over the seat towards the other end of the
row.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Look out for the Lady, Brock,” he
ordered, as he dashed past. “Some one must
help Barth. His foot is giving out, and he
will drop, in a minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, as swiftly as it had arisen, the panic
died away. Again and again the orchestra
pounded out <span class='it'>God Save the King</span> with an energetic
rhythm which could not fail to be reassuring.
The tumult in the galleries subsided;
one by one, in shamefaced fashion, the people
came straggling back to their seats. Brock was
mockingly recounting the list of his bruises,
while the manager completed his ill-timed
announcement of the sudden illness of one of
the singers. Then the curtain was rung down
and rung up again for a fresh start. Just
as it shivered and began to rise, Barth bent
forward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Mr. St. Jacques.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have to thank you for your help. I
needed it, and it was given in a most friendly
way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques had no idea of what those few
words cost the dignity of the taciturn young
Englishman. Otherwise, he would have framed
his answer in quite another fashion. As it was,
he shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You count it too highly,” he said, with
dry courtesy. “In our language we call
such things, not friendship, but just mere
chivalry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Nancy, though unswerving in her loyalty
to St. Jacques, felt a sudden pity for Mr.
Cecil Barth, as he shut his lips and leaned
back again in his chair.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TEN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy dear?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s accent was a little wishful, as
she turned her back on the habitant in the
courtyard and faced her father by the dressing-table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” The doctor was absently rummaging
among his neckties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can’t you spare time to go out with me,
this afternoon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Anywhere. Lorette, or Beaumanoir, or
even just up and down the city. You really
have seen nothing of Quebec, daddy, and I—once
in a while I get lonely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor dropped his neckties and looked
up sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lonely, Nancy? I am sorry. Do you
want to go home?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no!” The startled emphasis of her
accent left no doubt of its truthfulness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then what is it, child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing; only—It is just as I said.
Now and then I feel a little lonesome.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor smiled at his own reflection in
the mirror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought Brock and the Frenchman
looked out for that, Nancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They do,” she returned desperately; “and
that is just what worries me. It makes me
feel as if I needed to have some family back
of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gravely and steadily the doctor looked down
into her troubled eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Has anything—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy raised her head haughtily, as she
answered him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, daddy; trust me for that. The boys
are gentlemen, and, besides, they treat me as if
I were a mere cousin, or something else quite
unromantic. I like them, and I like to talk
with them. It is only—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her father understood her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you do not need to be anxious,
Nancy. Over the top of my manuscripts, I
keep a sharp eye out for my girl. And, besides,
it is a rare advantage for you to have the
friendship of the Lady. Even if I were not
here, I would trust you implicitly to her
care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy nodded in slow approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and she is one of us. Sometimes I
am half jealous of her. M. St. Jacques is her
devoted slave.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about Brock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy laughed with a carelessness which was
not entirely feigned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Brock burns incense before every
woman, young or old. He is adorable to us
all, and we all adore him. Still, he never really
takes us in earnest, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not so sure of that,” the doctor said,
with sudden decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You like Mr. Brock?” she questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should be an ungrateful wretch, if I
didn’t.” Then she added, “Speaking of ungrateful
wretches, daddy, was anything ever
more strange than the whole Barth episode?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t you told him yet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Told him! How could I? It is all I can
do not to betray myself by accident; I would
die rather than tell him deliberately. But I
can’t see how the man can help knowing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Extreme egotism coupled with extreme
myopia,” the doctor suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Exactly. If it were one of us alone, I
shouldn’t think so much about it; but it is a
mystery to me how he can see us both, without
having the truth dawn upon him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor pondered for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know, Nancy, I believe I haven’t
once come into contact with the fellow. Except
for the dining-room, I’ve not even been into
the same room with him. It is really wonderful
how little one can see of one’s neighbors.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy faced back to the window with a
jerk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And also how much,” she added mutinously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the doctor pursued his own train of
thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all, Nancy, it may be our place to
make the first advances. We are older—at
least, I am—and there are two of us. He may
be waiting for us to recognize him. I believe
I’ll look him up, this evening, and tell him
how we happen to be here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy faced out again with a second jerk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Daddy, if you dare to do such a thing!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? After all, I rather liked Barth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But surely you thought he was a gentleman,”
the doctor urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After a fashion,” Nancy admitted guardedly.
“Still, now that I have met him, I’d rather
let bygones be bygones. It would be maddening,
for instance, just when I was sailing past
him on my way in to supper, to have him remember
how I used to coil strips of red flannel
around his aristocratic ankle. No; we’ll let
the dead past bury its bandages and water them
with its liniment, daddy. If I am ever to
know Mr. Cecil Barth now, it must be as a
new acquaintance from London, not as my old
patient from Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet,” the doctor still spoke meditatively;
“Barth appreciated you, Nancy, and
he was certainly grateful.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl laughed wilfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He appreciated his hired nurse, daddy,
and he was grateful to me to the extent of paying
me my wages. By the way, I’d like that
money.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I would drop it into the lap of the Good
Sainte Anne. It is no small miracle to have
delivered a British Lion into the hands of an
American and allowed her to minister to his
wounded paw. It was a great experience,
daddy, and, now I think of it, I would like to
reward the saint according to her merits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor’s eyes brightened, as he looked
at her merry face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait,” he advised her. “Even now, the
miracle may not be complete.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She ran after him and caught him by the
lapels of his collar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, don’t talk in riddles,” she protested.
“And, anyway, promise me you won’t tell any
tales to Mr. Barth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear child, I have something to do,
besides forcing my acquaintance upon stray
young Englishmen who don’t care for it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She kissed him impetuously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Spoken like your daughter’s own father!”
she said approvingly. “Now, if you really
won’t go out to play with me, I’m going to
the library to read the new magazines.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later, Nancy was sitting by a window,
<span class='it'>Harper’s</span> in her lap and her eyes fixed on
the dark blue Laurentides to the northward.
The girl spent many a leisure hour in the grim
old building, once a prison, but now the home
of a little library whose walls breathed a mingled
atmosphere of mustiness and learning. Ancient
folios were not lacking; but Kipling was on the
upper shelves and one of the tables was littered
with rows of the latest magazines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To-day, however, Nancy’s mind was not
upon her story, nor yet upon the Laurentides
beneath her thoughtful gaze. The episode of
the previous night had left a strong impression
upon her. It was the first time she had seen
the three men together; she had watched them
with shrewd, impartial eyes. Britisher, Canadian,
and Frenchman, Catholic and Protestant:
three more distinct types could scarcely have
been gathered into the narrow limits of an
impromptu theatre party. Beyond the simple
attributes of manliness and breeding, they possessed
scarcely a trait in common. In two of
them, Nancy saw little to deplore; in all three,
she saw a good deal to like.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth she dismissed with a brief shake of
her head. He was undeniably plucky, far
more plucky than at first she had supposed.
To her energetic, healthy mind, there had been
nothing so very bad about a sprained ankle.
A little pain, a short captivity, and that was
the end of it. Once or twice it had seemed to
her that Barth had been needlessly depressed
by the situation, needlessly unresponsive to her
efforts to arouse him. It was only during the
past few days that she had seen what it really
meant: the physical pain and weariness to be
borne as best it might, in a strange city and
cut off from any friendly companionship. It
even occurred dimly to her mind that Barth
was not wholly responsible for his chilly inability
to make new friends, that it was just
possible he regretted the fact as keenly as any
one else. Moreover, Nancy was just. She
admitted, as she looked back over those ten
days at Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré, that Barth
had been singularly free from fault-finding and
complaint. She also admitted that his ignoring
of their past relations was no mere matter
of social snobbery. Mr. Cecil Barth was
totally ignorant of the identity of his former
nurse. Having exonerated him from the charge
of certain sins, Nancy dismissed him with a
shake of her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon Brock and St. Jacques, her mind
rested longer. Until the night before, they had
seemed to her to be a pair of boon comrades.
While their holiday lasted, they would make
merry together. When she turned her face to
the southward, the bonds of their acquaintance
would drop apart, and their lives would spin on
in their individual orbits. Now, all at once,
she questioned. The naked impulses of humanity
show themselves in times of danger.
At last night’s alarm, both Brock and St.
Jacques had turned instinctively to her protection.
Then the difference had showed
itself. Brock had given his whole care and
strength to her alone. St. Jacques had swiftly
assured himself that she was in safe hands;
then, with a caution to Brock to guard the
Lady, he had thrown himself to the rescue of
Mr. Cecil Barth, not because he liked Barth,
but because his instincts were all for the succoring
of the weak. All night long, Nancy
had gloried in Brock’s strength and in the
singleness of his devotion. Nevertheless, she
was woman enough to glory still more in the
more prosaic gallantry of the dark-browed
little Frenchman. As a rule, the pretty girl
in evening dress is prone to inspire more chivalry
than a taciturn Britisher of chilly manners
and unflattering tongue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Nancy buried her nose in her
story. Barth had come into the library and
seated himself at the table close at her elbow.
When she looked up again, he had put on his
glasses and was waiting to meet her eye. She
nodded to him, and, before she could go back
to her magazine again, he had turned his chair
until it faced her own. Over the blue Laurentides
the twilight was dropping fast. Upstairs
in the dim gallery the librarian was
moving slowly here and there among his books.
Otherwise the place was quite deserted, save for
the two young people sitting in the sunset glow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is this one of your haunts, too, Miss
Howard?” Barth asked, as he tossed his magazine
back to the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The matter-of-course friendliness of his tone
struck a new note in their acquaintance. Nancy
liked it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I often come here, when it is too
stormy for walking,” she assented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You walk a great deal?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Endlessly. Still, it doesn’t take so many
steps to circumnavigate this little city, I find.
I love to explore the out-of-the-way nooks and
corners; don’t you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did, until I was cut off in my prime.
I had only had two weeks, before disaster
overtook me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time, Nancy was mindful of her incognito.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You broke your ankle, I think?” she said
interrogatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sprained it. It amounts to the same thing
in the end.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it long ago?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Three weeks. Sometimes three weeks become
infinite.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it so painful?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, especially to my pride. It’s so babyish
to be ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you weren’t babyish at all,” Nancy
protested courteously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth stared blankly at her for a minute.
Then he laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You flatter me. Still, it’s not well to take
too much on trust, Miss Howard. But I am
glad if I’ve gained any reputation for pluck.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy interposed hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did it happen?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. The last I remember beforehand,
I was standing on the steps of Sainte
Anne, watching a pilgrimage getting itself
blessed. The next I knew, I was lying on my
back on the ground, with my ankle twisted
into a knot, and my future nurse taking full
possession of my case. That was your namesake,
Miss Howard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed. Was—was she—pretty?” Nancy
inquired, not quite certain what she was expected
to say next.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never knew. My glasses were lost in the
scrimmage, and I can’t see ten inches from my
nose without them. I couldn’t very well ask
her to come forward and be inspected at any
such range as that. I was sorry, too. The
girl really took very good care of me, and I
grew quite fond of her. Behind her back, I
used to call her my Good Sainte Anne. She
was Nancy, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s magazine slid to the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did she know it?” she asked, smiling a
little at her awkward efforts to reach the book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Allow me,” Barth said gravely. “No;
I am not sure that she did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When you meet her, next time, you can
tell her,” Nancy advised him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid I never shall meet her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The world is very tiny,” Nancy observed
sententiously. “As a rule, the same person is
bound to cross one’s trail twice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, besides, even if I did meet her, how
could I ever know her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could you help it?” she queried,
smiling into his face which seemed to her, that
afternoon, to be curiously boyish and likable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I have no idea how she looked.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You would know her voice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. I notice voices; but I rarely
remember them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But her name?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is of no use, just Nancy Howard.
Such a commonplace sort of name as that
is no clue. Why, you may be a Nancy
Howard, yourself, for anything I know to the
contrary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy laughed, as she rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I might also be your nurse,” she suggested.
“Stranger things than that have happened,
even in my experience, Mr. Barth. However,
when you do meet your Nancy Howard, I
hope you will tell her that you liked her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young fellow looked up at her a little
eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you suppose she would mind about
it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Women are generally glad to know when
they are liked,” Nancy said sagely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But most likely she knew it, without my
telling.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“More likely she never guessed it. You
probably lorded it over her and treated her
like a servant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>To her surprise, Barth blushed scarlet.
Then he answered frankly,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How you do get at things, Miss Howard!
The fact is, I tipped the girl, one night. It
seemed to me then merely the usual thing to
do. Since then, I haven’t been so sure. She
was quite a lady, and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy interrupted him ruthlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How did she take it?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As she would have taken a blow on the
cheek. I meant it well. I had given her a
bad day of it, and I thought it was only decent
to make up for it. I wish now I hadn’t; but I
couldn’t well ask for the money again, though
I knew from the way her heels hit the floor
that she was wishing she could throw it back
at me. Do you know,” Mr. Cecil Barth
added thoughtfully; “that I sometimes think
our English ways aren’t always understood
over here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, in that instant, Nancy forgave the
existence of the golden guinea, still reposing
among her superfluous hairpins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not always,” she assented. “Still, if you
were to tell your Nancy Howard what you
have just told me, I think she would understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but I couldn’t do that,” Barth
protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why not. Very likely she is
no more formidable than I am. Anyway, I
advise you to try.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she stood smiling down at him, there
came a click, and the dusky library was flooded
with the blaze from a dozen electric bulbs.
They both winced at the unexpected glare; then
Nancy’s eyes and Barth’s glasses met in a
steady gaze. His face was earnest; hers merry
and altogether winsome. Suddenly she held
out her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good by, Mr. Barth,” she said kindly.
“I am glad you have told me about this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He rose to his feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are going? May I walk back with
you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you so much for offering. It
would be a pleasure; but Mr. Brock is waiting
outside to take me for a turn on the
terrace.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, the next instant, Barth was left alone
with the librarian.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER ELEVEN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“Prove it,” Nancy said defensively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give me time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Time is something one seizes, not takes as
a free gift.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your utterances make superb epigrams,
Miss Howard. The only objection to them
arises when one stops to find out what they
really mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean that you can never prove to me
that the French are really outclassed by the
English,” she retorted, bringing the discussion
back to its point of departure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock looked down at her quizzically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall St. Jacques and I fight it out in three
rounds?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s no test. You’re not English.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in the real sense of it. But neither
is he French. We’re both of us relative
terms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so useless for the sake of argument,”
she replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the sake of nothing else, I trust,”
Brock said lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up at him with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Brock, I am not an ingrate. Without
you and M. St. Jacques, I should have
been a good deal more lonely, this past month.
My father is an old man, and not strong. He
has appreciated your courtesy to him, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock shifted his stick to his left hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we shake hands on it?” he said jovially.
“The month has been rather jolly for
us, as Barth would say. The Maple Leaf is
a mighty good sort of place; but the atmosphere
there is sometimes a little more mature
than one cares for. St. Jacques and I haven’t
given all the good times. But about the
argument: when can you take time to be
convinced?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By a walk to the Wolfe monument?” she
queried mockingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; by two hours of eloquent pleading
on my part. I propose to do it by sheer
weight of intellect and statistics. How about
to-morrow afternoon at three?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well,” she assented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ll cut the office for the afternoon. Shall
we choose the Saint Foye Road for the scene
of the fray?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you like,” she answered merrily. “But
remember that you are to do no monologues.
I reserve the right to interrupt, whenever I
choose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then they fell silent, as they tramped briskly
up and down the terrace. The lights from the
Frontenac beside them glowed in the purple
dusk and mingled with the glare that lingered
in the west. At their feet, the streets of the
Lower Town were crowded in the last mad
scurry of the dying day, and the river beyond
was dotted here and there with the moving
lights of an occasional ferry. Then a bugle
call rang down from the Citadel, and Nancy
roused herself abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I suppose we really ought to go to supper,”
she said regretfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t late.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but my father will be waiting.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reluctantly Brock faced about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I suppose there are more days to
come,” he observed philosophically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Especially to-morrow,” she reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth was at the table, when they entered
the dining-room. Eager, flushed with her swift
exercise in the crisp night air and daintily trim
from top to toe, Nancy seemed to him a most
attractive picture as she came towards him.
Brock was close behind; together, they were
laughing over some jest of which he was in
ignorance. Nevertheless, Nancy paused beside
his chair long enough to give him a
friendly word of greeting, and Barth smiled
back at her blissfully. For an instant, it occurred
to him that it was rather pleasant to be
no longer on the outer edge of The Maple Leaf.
At a first glance, he had resented the supremacy
of this American girl in an English house.
The shorter grew his radius, however, the
surer grew his allegiance to the focal point.
American or no American, Nancy was undeniably
pretty, her gowns threw the gowns of his
own sisters into disrepute, and, moreover, that
afternoon, she had shown herself altogether
friendly and womanly and winning. Accordingly,
he sowed the seeds of incipient indigestion
by bolting his supper at a most unseemly
speed, in order to gain possession of a chair
near the parlor door. Close study of the situation,
during many previous evenings, had
informed him that this chair held a position of
strategic importance. As a rule, St. Jacques
had occupied it, while Barth had rested on his
dignity in remote corners. With the tail of
his eye, Barth had assured himself that the
Frenchman was at the final stage of the meal,
when he himself reached the table. However,
the Frenchman was munching toast and marmalade
in a most leisurely fashion, turning now
and then for a word with Brock and Nancy;
and Barth felt sure that he could overtake him.
His surety increased as St. Jacques, abandoning
his toast, took possession of a mammoth
bun and a fresh supply of marmalade. Barth,
who scorned all things of the jammy persuasion,
finished his meat with the greed of a half-grown
puppy, scalded his throat with the tea
which had obstinately resisted his efforts to
cool it, and, with a brief nod to St. Jacques,
left the table and betook himself to the parlor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Monsieur has a haste upon himself, to-night,”
St. Jacques observed dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His early training had been potent, and St.
Jacques no longer wasted upon Barth any
conversational efforts whatsoever. In Nancy’s
presence, he treated the Englishman with distant
courtesy. In the face of Brock’s teasing,
he gave him an occasional grudging word of
moral support; but, at the table, he ignored
him completely. According to the creed of
Adolphe St. Jacques, a man should never
allow himself to be snubbed twice by the same
person. He carried his creed so far that,
waitresses failing, he chose to rise and march
completely around the table rather than ask
for a stray pepper-pot lodged at Barth’s other
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the time Barth had gone twice through
the diminutive evening paper, advertisements
and all, he came to the tardy conclusion that
the race was not always to the swift. He
knew that Brock had left the house. Hat in
hand, the tall Canadian had come into the
parlor for a book. The next minute, the
front door had slammed, and Brock’s measured
stride had passed the parlor windows.
Brock gone, Barth wondered what could be
keeping Nancy. Not even a healthy American
appetite could linger for an hour and a
half over a meal of cold beef and marmalade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He started upon a third tour of the paper,
in true British fashion beginning with the editorials,
and finally losing himself in an enthusiastic
account of a recent opening of fall hats.
By the time he realized that he was mentally
trying each of the hats upon Nancy Howard’s
auburn hair, he also realized that it was time
he roused himself to action. Letting the
newspaper slide to the floor, he rose and
walked out into the hall. From the office
beyond, there came the low, continuous buzz
of earnest voices. Rising on his toes, Barth
peered cautiously around the corner. Then
he seized his hat and stick and, stamping out
of the house, banged the street door behind
him. The Lady was temporarily absent. In
her place, the office chair was occupied by
Nancy and comfortably settled opposite to
Nancy was M. Adolphe St. Jacques.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Laval had a banquet at the St. Louis, that
night. It began late and ended early. From
certain random words he had overheard, Barth
knew that St. Jacques was not only to be
present, but was to be one of the speakers.
Accordingly, a personal animosity mingled
with his annoyance at the sounds from next
door which broke in upon his dreams. The
singing was off the key; the cheering was harsh
and unduly loud, and when at last <span class='it'>God Save
the King</span> was followed by a rush into the quiet
street, Barth crawled out of bed and stood
shivering at the window, as the tri-colored
banner and its accompanying crowd marched
past his ducal residence. In his present
mood, it would have been a consolation to
have seen that St. Jacques was the worse for
his revel. However, that consolation was
denied him. In the sturdy color-bearer heading
the line, he failed to recognize his table
companion; the other revellers tramped along
as steadily as did the soldiers going home from
church parade. In the depths of his swaddling
blankets, Barth shivered. He shivered again,
as he crawled back into the icy sheets which he
had thoughtlessly left open to the chill night air.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His spirits rose, next morning, when he discovered
that St. Jacques did not appear at
breakfast. They fell again, when Nancy also
failed to appear. His masculine mind could
not be expected to discern that she had risen
early, in order to attack a basket heaped with
long arrears of undarned socks and flimsy
stockings. His near-sighted eyes had not discovered
Nancy, sitting at her own front window,
with a stout number thirteen drawn on over
her slender hand. Nancy saw him, however;
and, in the midst of her musings, she took
friendly note of the fact that, this morning,
Barth scarcely limped at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth loitered in his room until the dinner
hour was past. To the Lady he gave the excuse
of important letters; but a copper coin
would have paid the postal bills incurred by
his morning’s work. The honest fact was that
he longed acutely for more of Nancy’s society,
and he had no idea how to set about obtaining
it. To ask it would be too bald a compliment;
he lacked the arrogant graces of his
Canadian rivals who appropriated the girl
promptly and quite as a matter of course.
Barth had been used to more deliberate and
tentative methods. Nevertheless, as he stared
at the yellow walls of his room, he took a sudden
resolve. English methods failing, he
would, according to the best of his ability,
adopt the methods of America. In his turn,
he too would take possession of Nancy.
With Nancy’s possible wishes in the matter,
he concerned himself not at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Too bad it rains!” Brock said, as he met
Nancy at dinner, that noon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because you must delay your argument?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Because we can’t have it in the open
air. The Saint Foye Road must be changed
for the parlor.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Can you do it there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? It is always empty, in the
afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t mean that. But will there be
room for you there?” Nancy questioned, with
lazy impertinence. “I have always noticed
that a man needs to gesticulate a great deal,
whenever he is arguing for a lost cause.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock laughed, as he patted his side pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be too sure it is lost. You haven’t
seen my documents yet. Can you be ready,
directly after dinner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As soon as I see my father off. Else he
would be sure to forget his goloshes and neglect
to open his umbrella. A father is a great responsibility;
isn’t it, daddy?” she added, with
a little pat on the gray tweed sleeve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nearly an hour later, Barth bounced into the
room. By largesse wisely distributed, he had
gained a good dinner, in spite of his tardiness.
He had found Brock’s coat hanging on the
rack where he had left his own; and experience
had taught him where Brock, once inside The
Maple Leaf, was generally to be found. The
office was quite deserted; and, with unerring
instinct, Barth betook himself in the direction
of the parlor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the angle behind the half-shut door, at a
table covered with maps and papers, Brock
and Nancy sat side by side. They looked up
in surprise, as Barth dashed into the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good afternoon, Miss Howard,” he said
abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Brock who answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You appear to be in haste about something,”
he remarked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. I have no engagement for the
afternoon. I just looked in to see if Miss
Howard—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again it was Brock who answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard has an engagement.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To—?” Barth queried, as he edged
towards Nancy’s side of the table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Craftily Brock avoided the ambiguous
preposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard and I are busy together,
this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, really. I am very sorry. I hope I
don’t intrude.” And, with the hope still
dangling from his lips, Barth plumped himself
down on the sofa beside them and felt
about for his glasses. As soon as they were
found and settled on his nose, he turned to
Nancy. “I do hope I’m not in the way,”
he reiterated spasmodically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock was growling defiantly in his throat;
but Nancy’s answer was dutifully courteous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not at all, Mr. Barth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are sure you wouldn’t rather I went
away?” he persisted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It isn’t our parlor,” Nancy reminded him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yours by right of possession.” As he
spoke, Barth arose and carefully closed the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. And we could easily move out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth looked startled. It was hard enough
to force himself to this cheerful arrogance of
manner. It was harder still to have the manner
miss fire in this fashion. It was thus, to
his mind, that Brock was accustomed to take
forcible possession of Nancy’s leisure hours.
He had never heard her suggest the advisability
of moving out, when Brock came in
upon the scene. Vaguely conscious that something
was amiss, Barth nevertheless persevered
in his undertaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but why should you move out?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s eyes lighted, half with amusement,
half with impatience. What was the man
driving at? Only yesterday she had been
ready to accept him as a friend, as a man of
tact and ingrained breeding. Now his former
obtuseness seemed to have returned upon him,
fourfold. And she had just been explaining
to Brock that the man wasn’t half bad, after
all. The question of what Brock must be
thinking of her taste lent an added tinge of
acidity to her reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Merely in case you wished to move in,” she
answered, with the lightest possible of laughs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth turned scarlet; but he valiantly sought
to explain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I only came in here, because I was
looking for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From a man of Barth’s previous habits of
speech, this was rather too direct. In her
turn, Nancy became scarlet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you wish, Mr. Barth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, just to—to talk to you. It is a
beastly day, you know; and I thought—I
fancied—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy cut in remorselessly. Instead of
recognizing Barth’s imitation of the American
manner, she came to the swift conclusion that
his vagueness was due to temporary dementia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry, Mr. Barth; but I am very
busy with Mr. Brock. Don’t let us drive you
away, though. We can go to the office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But don’t do that. Stay here. That’s
what I came for. I fancied you would like to
have a little more talk about Sainte Anne.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy felt Brock’s keen gray eyes fixed
upon her, felt the world of merriment in their
depths. She reflected swiftly. During the
past twenty hours, there had been scant chance
that Barth should have discovered her identity.
His suggestion was doubtless only the random
result of chance. Nevertheless, with Brock’s
eyes upon her, she was unable to parry the
suggestion with her wonted ease.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should I care to talk about Sainte
Anne?” she asked coldly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I thought you seemed interested, last
night.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Nancy felt Brock’s eyes on her, and
she chafed at the false position in which she
found herself. It was plain that Brock took
it for granted that she had decoyed the unsuspecting
Barth into telling over the tale of his
experiences; and Nancy, rebelling at the suspicion,
was powerless to deny it. She felt a
momentary pity for the young Englishman
who seemed bent upon offering himself up as
a victim to his allied foes, yet she found it
impossible to come to his rescue without imperiling
her secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly Barth spoke again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you ever at Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré,
Miss Howard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was an instant’s pause, when it seemed
to Nancy that Brock must be able to count the
throbbing of her pulse. Then she answered
quietly,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Once, quite a long time ago. However,
the whole episode is so unpleasant that I rarely
allow myself to think much about it. Mr.
Brock, perhaps we’d better go out to the office,
if Mr. Barth will excuse us.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWELVE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy spent the evening in the Valley
of Humiliation, Barth spent it in the
office with the Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But what did you say to irritate her?”
the Lady asked at length, when Barth, by
devious courses, had brought the conversation
around to Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothing. I wouldn’t irritate Miss
Howard for any consideration,” he returned
eagerly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But she was irritated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Y—es; but I didn’t do it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady smiled. Liking Barth as she did,
she could still realize that his point of view
might be antagonistic to a girl like Nancy.
Moreover, she too had seen Barth, that noon.
She too had wondered at the unaccountable
elation of his manner; and she had recorded
the impression that, when a narrow Britisher
begins to expand his limits, the broad American
would better make haste to seek shelter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me all about it,” she said kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth’s feigned arrogance of manner had
fallen from him; it was a most humble-minded
Britisher who stood before the Lady, and the
Lady pitied him. Barth’s eyes looked tired;
the corners of his mouth drooped, and dejection
sat heavy upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady turned a chair about until it faced
her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sit down and tell me all about it, Mr.
Barth,” she repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth obeyed. Later, alone in his room,
he wondered how it was that he had been
betrayed into speaking so frankly to a comparative
stranger; yet even then he felt no
regrets. A petted younger son, he had been
too long deprived of feminine companionship
and understanding. Now that it was offered,
he accepted it eagerly. Moreover, Barth was
by no means the first lonely youth to pour the
story of his woes into the Lady’s ear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Seated with the light falling full upon his
honest, boyish face, he plunged at once into
his confession, with the absolute unreserve that
only a man customarily reserved can show.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is just a case of Miss Howard,” he said
bluntly. “She is an American, and not at all
like the girls I have known, treats you like a
good fellow one minute, and freezes you up the
next. I can’t seem to understand her at all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What makes you try?” the Lady asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It never seemed to occur to the young fellow
to blush, as he answered,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I like her a great deal better than
any other girl I ever saw.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of herself, the Lady smiled at the
unqualified terms of his reply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It hasn’t taken you long to find it out.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. But what’s the use of waiting to
make up your mind about a thing of that
sort?” Barth responded, as he plunged his
hands into his trouser pockets. “You like
a person, or else you don’t. I like Miss
Howard; but, by George, I can’t understand
her in the least!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is there any use of trying?” the Lady
inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth stared at her blankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, rather! How else would I know how
to get on with her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, by your own story, you don’t succeed
in getting on with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth closed the circle of her argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Because I can’t seem to understand
her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you sure she understands herself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. Miss Howard is very clever,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps. It doesn’t always follow. And
are you sure she cares to have you understand
her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young Englishman winced at the
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What should she have against me?” he
asked directly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not saying that she has anything,”
the Lady answered, in swift evasion. “Sometimes
it is to their best friends that girls show
their most contradictory sides.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh. You mean it is one of her American
ways?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if you choose to call it that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard is very American,” he observed
a little regretfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, my dear boy, so are you very
British.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. I mean to be,” Barth answered
quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And perhaps Miss Howard finds it hard
to understand your British ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth looked perplexed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. I think not,” he said slowly.
“She never acts at all embarrassed, when she
is with me. In fact,” he laughed deprecatingly;
“I am generally the one to be embarrassed,
when we are together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a short pause. Then Barth continued
thoughtfully, as if from the heart of his
reverie,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And I didn’t like her especially, at first.
She seemed a bit—er—cocksure and—er—energetic.
Now I am beginning to like her
more and more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you seen much of her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. It is only once that we have had any
real talk together. That was yesterday, at the
library. It’s a queer old place, and one talks
there in spite of one’s self. We had a good
time. But generally those other fellows are
around in the way.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady raised her brows interrogatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Brock and that Frenchman,” Barth
explained. “They are always with her; they
haven’t any hesitation in coming into the
drawing-room and carrying her off, just as I
am getting ready to talk to her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A blot on the Lady’s account book demanded
her full attention for a moment.
Then she looked up at Barth again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you try the same tactics?” she
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why don’t you carry her off, just as Mr.
Brock is getting ready to talk to her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because he is so quick that he gets right
about it, before I have time to begin. Mr.
Brock has a good deal of the American way,
himself,” Mr. Cecil Barth added, with an accent
of extreme disfavor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady smiled again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think you’ll have to develop some
American ways, yourself, Mr. Barth,” she
suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the note of dejection came into his
voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I tried. Tried it, this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And?” she said interrogatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was all wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. I thought I did it just as
Mr. Brock does. I went into the drawing-room
and found them together, just the way
he has so often found us. I began to talk to
her just as he does, only of course I wouldn’t
think of chaffing her. You know he chaffs
her, and she can’t seem to make him stop,”
Barth added, in hasty explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you talk to her about?” the
Lady queried.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s just it. I didn’t get started talking
at all. I just asked her if she wouldn’t
like to talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Once more the Lady bent over the blot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What did you invite her to talk about?”
she asked quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré and all that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause. Then,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go on,” said the Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We’d been talking about it in the library,
just the afternoon before, and she seemed interested,
asked about my accident and my
nurse and all. Really, we were just beginning
to get on capitally, when she had to go. I
thought the best thing to do would be to begin
where we left off; but she turned very cross,
wouldn’t say a word to me and finally picked
up her books and walked out of the room. I
don’t see what I could have done to displease
her.” And, putting on his glasses, Barth
stared at the Lady with disconsolate, questioning
blue eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady laughed a little. Nevertheless,
she felt a deep longing to scold Nancy, to give
Fate a sound box on the ear and to take Mr.
Cecil Barth into her motherly embrace. She
liked his frankness, liked the under note of respect
which mingled in his outspoken admiration
for Nancy. She could picture the whole
scene: Barth’s nervous assumption of ease
confronted with the nonchalant assurance of
Brock, Nancy’s hidden amusement at the tentative
request for polite conversation, and her
open consternation at the subject which Barth
had proposed for discussion. It was funny.
She looked upon the scene with the eyes of
Nancy and Brock, yet her whole womanly
sympathy lay with the Englishman, an open-hearted,
tongue-tied alien in a land of easy
speech. Barth’s hand rested on the corner of
her desk. Bending forward, she laid her own
hand across his fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t worry, Mr. Barth,” she said kindly.
“You and Miss Howard will be good friends in
time. It is an odd position, your meeting here
on neutral soil. Your whole ways of life are so
different that you find it hard to understand
each other. I am half-way between you, and
I know you both. What is more, I like you
both, and I’d like to see you good friends.
Leave something to time, and a great deal to
Miss Howard. And—forgive me, my dear
boy, but I am quite old enough to be your
mother—I would let the American ways take
care of themselves, and just be my own English
self. If Miss Howard is going to like
you at all, it will be for yourself, not for any
misfit manners you may choose to put on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, the question is, is she going to like
me at all?” Barth said despondingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady’s eyes roved over him from the
parting of his yellow hair to the toes of his
unmistakably British shoes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive my bluntness,” she said, with a
smile; “if I say that I don’t see how she can
very well help it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Half an hour later, she knocked at Nancy’s
door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I come in?” she asked blithely.
“All the evening, I have been talking to a
most downcast young Englishman, and now I
have come up to administer justice to you.
The justice will be tempered with mercy;
nevertheless, I think you deserve a lecture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your Englishman is an idiot,” Nancy observed
dispassionately; “and I don’t deserve
any lecture at all. However, go on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Crossing the room, the Lady turned on the
electric light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nancy Howard,” she said sternly; “your
voice was suspicious enough; but your eyes
betray you. You’ve been crying.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What if I have?” the girl asked defiantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady’s quick eye caught the glitter of
a gold coin on the dressing-table. Then she
turned back to Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Girls like you don’t cry for nothing,”
she remarked. “May I sit down on the
bed?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy nodded. Then she replied to the
first remark.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wasn’t crying for nothing. I was crying
over my conscience.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What has your conscience been doing?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pricking,” the girl answered frankly. “I
hate to be nasty to people; but now and then
I am driven into it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Barth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, Mr. Barth,” Nancy assented, with an
accent of finality. “Now go on with your
lecture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, Nancy, you sometimes take away
even my Canadian breath. I can imagine that
you leave Mr. Barth gasping.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Barth would gasp in a stilly vacuum,”
Nancy replied tranquilly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very likely. It is possible that you might
do likewise. But to my point. Was it quite
fair, Nancy, to encourage the boy to talk about
the Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré episode, and then
snub him, the next time he alluded to it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did he tell you any such tale as that?”
Nancy demanded, in hot wrath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He—he implied it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you believed him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I couldn’t understand your doing it.”
The Lady began to wonder whether the promised
lecture were to be given or received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy sprang up and walked the length of
the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the horrid little cad!” she said
explosively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady turned champion of the absent
Englishman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He’s not a cad, Nancy; he is a thoroughbred
little Englishman. I have seen his type
before, though never so extreme a case. He
is frank and honest as a boy can be. He’s
born to his British ways, as we are born to
ours. It is only that you’re not used to him,
and don’t understand him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He doesn’t leave much to the imagination,”
Nancy observed scathingly. Then she
dropped down beside the Lady, and looked
her straight in the eyes. “I don’t want you
to be thinking horrid things of me,” she said
slowly. “I don’t want you to think I have
been two-sided with Mr. Barth. After what
happened at Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré, I have
tried to keep out of his way as much as possible.
It has been a miserable chance that has
brought us into such close quarters; a recognition
wasn’t going to be pleasant for either
of us. But, every time I meet the man, he
seems possessed with an insane desire to babble
to me about his ankle. I could tell more
about it than he can, for I was in league with
the doctor, and heard all the professional details.
A dozen times, I have been on the very
verge of betraying myself. Last night, it
reached a climax. He found me alone in the
library, and he began to talk. Really, he was
more agreeable than I ever knew him before.
But you know how it is: the presence of a
grass widow always moves you to rake up
all the divorce scandals of your experience.
Before we had talked for ten minutes, the man
was calmly informing me that he was really
very fond of his nurse, that, in the secret
recesses of his heart, he called her his Good
Sainte Anne, that he wished he could meet
her again, and finally that he was very sorry
he had tipped her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; I don’t mean that,” Nancy protested
hastily. “You are the disloyal one now. He
didn’t imply that she had not deserved the
tip. His regrets were for sentimental reasons,
not frugal. He was very nice and honest
about it, and I never liked him half so well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And showed it,” the Lady added gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very likely I did. I don’t see why not.
But, to-day!” Nancy paused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What happened?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t he tell you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only his side of it. Still, I could imagine
the rest.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; you couldn’t. No one could, without
having seen it. He came dashing, fairly
splashing, into the parlor where Mr. Brock
and I were squabbling over politics. Only a
little while before, I had been defending him
to Mr. Brock, telling him that Mr. Barth was
really a gentleman and clever, that I liked him
extremely. And then, on the heels of that
statement, the man came whacking into the
room, interrupted our talk without a shadow
of an apology and then, after acting like a
crazy being, he capped the climax of his sins
by specifically inviting me to talk to him some
more about Sainte Anne.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rising cadence was met by the falling
one. Then silence followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” Nancy resumed at length; “you see
my predicament. Mr. Brock knows the whole
story; I let it out to him, the day we met. I
had no idea I should ever meet Mr. Barth again,
and I used no names. Mr. Brock patched together
the two ends of the story, and told M. St.
Jacques; and it has been all I could do to keep
them from using it as an instrument of torture
on poor Mr. Barth. To-day, I knew Mr. Brock
was furious at him; I knew he was longing to
say something, and, worst of all, I knew he
thought, as you did, that I had been coaxing
Mr. Barth to make an idiot of himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” the Lady said again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he does it, without being coaxed,”
Nancy responded mutinously. Then she relented.
“But he was so pitifully bent on
making a fool of himself, just when I had been
pleading his cause to the very best of my
ability! He babbled at us till I was on the
very verge of frenzy. Stop him I could not.
He absolutely refused to know when he was
snubbed. At last, I fled from the scene and
took Mr. Brock with me, and, for all I know
to the contrary, the man may be sitting there
in the parlor, babbling still.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy laughed; but the tears were near the
surface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And then?” the Lady asked gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I came up here and bemoaned my
sins,” Nancy answered, with utter frankness.
“I hate to be hateful; but I lost my head,
and couldn’t help it. Now I am sorry, for I
truly like Mr. Barth, and I know I scratched
him till he felt it clear down through his
veneering. He has not only spoiled my
whole evening; but, worse than that, I have
an apology on my hands, and I really don’t
see how I am going to make it, without being
too specific.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Thirty-six hours after his banquet,
St. Jacques reappeared in the dining-room.
Barth eyed him narrowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Back again?” Nancy queried in blithe
greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a good while. How are you feeling?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth felt a shock of surprise. Did American
girls have no reservations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A good deal the worse for wear,” the
Frenchman was replying, with equal frankness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Any particular spot?” she inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, my head. There’s nothing much to
show; but it feels swollen to twice its usual
size, to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am so sorry,” she answered sympathetically.
“Can I do anything for it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques laughed, as his face lighted with
the expression Nancy liked so well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Does your pity go a long way?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At your service.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To the extent of a walk, after dinner?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, if you feel up to it,” she answered.
“It is a delightful day, and you know I want
to hear all about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Towards the middle of the morning, Barth
sought the Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, it is none of my affair; but what is
the girl thinking of?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady’s mind chanced to be upon the
problem involved in a departing waitress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What girl?” she asked blankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the matter with Miss Howard
now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t know. What can she be thinking
of, to go for a walk with a man in his condition?”
he expostulated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whose condition?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That French Catholic, Mr. St. Jacques.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But there’s nothing wrong with his condition.
It is only his head,” the Lady explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. That is what I mean. She
knows it, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. We all know it, and we all are
so sorry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth was still possessed of his self-made idea,
and continued his argument upon that basis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Naturally. One is always sorry for such
things. Sometimes even good fellows get
caught. Still, that is no reason a girl should
speak of it, to say nothing of going to walk
with the fellow. Really, Miss Howard’s
father ought to put a stop to it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time, even the Lady lost her patience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, Mr. Barth, I don’t see why. On
your own showing, you asked Miss Howard
to let you walk home from the library with
her, two days ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But that was different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see how. M. St. Jacques is as
much a gentleman as you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh. Do you think so? But what about
his head?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the instant, the Lady questioned the
stability of Barth’s own head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I really can’t see how that enters into the
question at all. Even a gentleman is liable to
be hit on the head, when he is playing lacrosse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lacrosse?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. M. St. Jacques spent yesterday at
Three Rivers with the lacrosse team from
Laval.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh.” In his mortification at his own
blunder, Barth’s <span class='it'>oh</span> was more dissyllabic even
than usual. “I didn’t understand. I thought
it was only the result of the banquet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady looked at him with a steady,
kindly smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Barth,” she said; “I really think that
idea was not quite worthy of you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Barth shut his lips in plucky acceptance
of the rebuke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The haunt of tourists and the prey of every
artist, be his tools brushes or mere words,
Sous-le-Cap remains the crowning joy of
ancient Quebec. The inconsequent bends in
its course, the wood flooring of its roadway,
the criss-cross network of galleries and verandas
which join the two rows of houses and
throw the street into a shadow still deeper
than that cast by the overhanging cape, the
wall of naked rock that juts out here and there
between the houses piled helter-skelter against
the base of the cliff: these details have endured
for generations, and succeeding generations
well may pray for their continued
endurance. Quebec could far better afford to
lose the whole ornate length of the Grand
Allée than even one half the flying galleries
and fluttering clothes-lines of little Sous-le-Cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And yet,” St. Jacques said thoughtfully;
“this hardly makes me proud of my countrymen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the many-colored garments flapping
on the clothes-lines, Nancy glanced down at a
scarlet-coated child playing in the open doorway
of a shop at her side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t think of the sociological aspect of
the case,” she advised him. “Once in a while,
it is better to be simply picturesque than it is
to be hygienic. I have seen a good deal of
America; I know nothing to compare with
this.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques picked his way daintily among
the rubbish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I hope not. I also hope there’s not much
in France.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have been there?” Nancy questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not yet. After two more years at
Laval.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To live there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only to study. My home is here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not in Quebec?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. In Rimouski. I am a countryman,”
he added, with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And shall you go back there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is impossible to tell. I hope not; but
my father is growing older, and there are little
children. In a case like that, one can never
choose for himself,” he said, with a little accent
of regret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But your profession,” Nancy reminded
him. “Will there be any opening for it
there?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is always an opening. It is only a
question whether one feels too large to try to
enter it. If I were as free as Mr. Brock, I
would come back here, or go to The States.
As it is, I am not free.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me about Rimouski,” Nancy urged
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you care to know? It is a little
place. The ocean-going steamers stop there;
there is a cathedral and a seminary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it pretty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His eyes lighted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was born there, Miss Howard. It is
impossible for me to say. Perhaps sometime
you may see it for yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I might,” the girl assented idly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next minute, she felt herself blushing,
as she met the eager look on the face of her
companion, and she hurried away from the
dangerous subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long shall you be abroad?” she
asked hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two years.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nearly five years before you go into your
professional work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” His accent dropped a little. “It
is long to wait.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It depends on the way the time goes,”
Nancy suggested, with a fresh determination to
drive the minor key from his voice. “Between
banquets and lacrosse matches and
broken heads, your days ought not to drag.
Was it really so bad a bump you had?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Pushing his cap still farther to the back of
his head, St. Jacques lifted the dark hair from
his forehead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So much,” he said coolly, as he displayed a
short, deep cut.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy exclaimed in horror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M. St. Jacques! And you take it without
a word of complaint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time, he laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Complaint never mends a split head, Miss
Howard. We Frenchmen take our knocks
and say nothing.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that aimed at Mr. Barth?” Nancy asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques shook his head; but his lips and
eyes denied the gesture of negation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really,” she urged; “he didn’t complain.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but he talked about it more than I
cared to listen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Aren’t you a little hard on him, M. St.
Jacques?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Frenchman looked up in surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is he your friend, then?” he queried
gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. No. I don’t know.” Nancy was
vainly struggling to frame her reply according
to the strictest truth. “I think he thought
so; but now we don’t know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid I do not understand,” St.
Jacques said, with slow formality. “As your
friend, I shall treat him with respect. Otherwise—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, he isn’t my friend,” Nancy explained
hurriedly. “We have had an awful fight; at
least, not exactly a fight, but I was rude to
him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques interrupted her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then it will make up for some of the times
he has been rude to me, and I shall be still
more in your debt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy shook her head ruefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; we can’t square our accounts that
way, M. St. Jacques. I have seen Mr. Barth
detestably rude to you, and it never once has
dawned upon him that he wasn’t the very
pink of courtesy. With me, it was different.
I did my very best, not only to be rude to him;
but to have him know that I meant it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again came the answering flash over the
Frenchman’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very glad you did it,” he said briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’m not, then,” Nancy said flatly. “I
hate making apologies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then let him apologize to you,” St. Jacques
suggested, laughing. “He has no right to
put himself in the wrong so far as to make you
feel it worth your while to be rude to him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy laughed in her turn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M. St. Jacques, you do not like Mr.
Barth,” she said merrily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, Miss Howard; I do not. It will be
a happy day for me, when he takes himself out
to his ranch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I shall have gone, long before that,”
she said thoughtfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques turned upon her with a suddenness
which startled her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So soon as that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sooner. Three or four weeks more here
will see the end of our stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The blood rolled hotly upward across his
swarthy face. Then it rolled back again, leaving
behind it a pallor that brought his thin lips
and resolute chin into strong relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry,” he said slowly. “I thought
you had come to stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Only till my father has ransacked every
book in your Laval library,” she said, with
intentional lightness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He declined to answer her tone. The words
of his reply dropped, clear, distinct, slow, upon
her ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No matter. Perhaps some day you may
come back to Canada, Miss Howard, come
back, I mean, to stay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy drew two or three short, quick breaths.
Then she laughed with a forced mirth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps. One can never tell. I like
Canada,” she said nervously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques faced her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the Canadians?” he asked steadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His dark eyes held hers for a moment.
Then she found herself repeating his words,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and the Canadians.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later, she gave a sudden start of
surprise and relief. Rounding a sharp angle
in the winding street, they had found themselves
directly upon the heels of Mr. Cecil
Barth who was sauntering slowly along just
ahead of them. Turning at the sound of their
feet on the board roadway, he bowed to Nancy
with deprecating courtesy, to her companion
with studied carelessness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s quick eye caught the veiled hostility
of the salute exchanged by the two men.
Her own poise was shaken by the little scene
through which she had just been passing, but
she made a desperate effort to regain control
of the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Barth,” she said impetuously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth had resumed his stroll. At her words,
he turned back instantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not wait for us?” she suggested, as
she held out her hand with frank cordiality.
“M. St. Jacques deserves congratulations from
us all, for his record at lacrosse, yesterday; and
I know you’ll like to add your voice to the
general chorus. And, besides that, I owe you
an apology. I was very rude to you, yesterday;
but, at least, I have the saving
grace to be thoroughly ashamed of myself,
to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Barth, as he took her hand, felt that
that minute atoned for many a bad half-hour
she had given him in the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Together, they came out from under the
hanging balconies, strayed on through Sault-au-Matelot
and, coming up Mountain Hill
Street, wandered out along the Battery. There
they lingered to lean on the wall and stare
across the river at the heights of Lévis bathed
in its sunset light which is neither purple, nor
yet altogether of gold. To Nancy, the light
was typical of the hour. The girl was no
egotist; yet all at once she instinctively realized
that one or the other of these men was holding
the key to her life. Which it should be, as
yet she could not know. The hour had come,
unsought, unexpected. For the present, it
was better to drift. The mood of St. Jacques
was kindred to her own. As for Barth, he was
supremely content, without in the least knowing
why his recent dissatisfaction should have
fallen from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While they lingered by the wall, to watch
the fading glow, Dr. Howard suddenly stepped
out into the road behind them. As he came
through the gate in the old stone wall, his
glance rested upon the trio of familiar figures,
and his voice rang out in hearty greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, Nancy,” he called. “Are you watching
for a hostile fleet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the eagerness which never failed to
welcome him, she turned to face her father;
but, midway in her turning, she was stopped
by Barth’s voice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nancy!” he echoed. “Are you another
Nancy Howard?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She faltered. Then she met his blue eyes
full and steadily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she said, with fearless directness.
“So far as I know, Mr. Barth, I am the only
one.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>With masculine obtuseness, Barth regarded
it as a matter of pure chance
that he found Nancy standing alone in the hall,
that night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please go away and take M. St. Jacques
with you,” she had begged Brock, as he had
left the table. “I must have it out with him
sometime, and I’d rather have it over.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock looked at his watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will an hour be long enough?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t tell. Please bid me good night
now,” she urged him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled reassuringly down into her anxious
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t take the situation too tragically,
Miss Howard,” he said, with a brotherly kindness
she was quick to feel as a relief to her
strained nerves. “You weren’t to blame in
the first place, and I can bear witness that you
have been the most loyal friend he has had.
If he is a bit unpleasant about it, send him to
me, and I’ll knock him down.” He rose;
but he lingered long enough to add, “I’ll look
in on you, about nine o’clock, and see if I can
help pick up the pieces.” And, with a nod of
farewell, he was gone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you busy?” Barth asked, as he joined
her, a little later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Am I ever busy in this indolent atmosphere?”
she questioned in return, with a futile
effort for her usual careless manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes, as far as I am concerned. But
what if we come into the drawing-room? It
is quieter there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He spoke gently, yet withal there was something
masterful in his manner, and Nancy felt
that her hour was come. Nervously she tried
to anticipate it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you need a quiet place for the scene
of the fray?” she asked flippantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fray?” His accent was interrogative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the discussion, then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was moving a chair forward. Then he
looked up sharply, as he stood aside for her to
take it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t see that there is reason for any
discussion, Miss Howard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you know you think I have been
playing a double game with you,” Nancy
broke out, in sudden irritation at his quiet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His hands in his pockets, he walked across
to the window and stood looking out. Then
he turned to face Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I am not sure that I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You feel that I ought to have told you
before?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would have been a little fairer to me,”
he assented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why,” she said defensively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth raised his blue eyes to her face, and
she repented her untruth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At least,” she amended; “I don’t see
what difference it would have made.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not. Still, it isn’t pleasant
to be a stranger, and the one person outside
a secret which concerns one’s self most
of all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish you had told me,” he said thoughtfully.
“It might have prevented some things
that now I should like to forget.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For instance?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For instance, the way I have told you
details with which you were already familiar.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy laughed nervously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And some with which I wasn’t familiar at
all,” she added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth’s color rose to the roots of his hair,
and he bit his lip. Then he answered, with
the same level accent,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But even you must admit that my
error was unintentional.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy sat up straight in her deep chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even me!” she echoed stormily. “What
do you mean, Mr. Barth?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He met her angry eyes fearlessly, yet with
perfect respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even you who were willing to take all the
advantage of a complete stranger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I took no advantage,” she protested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he admitted, after a pause. “Perhaps
it was forced upon you. However, you
accepted it. Miss Howard,” he paused again;
“we Englishmen dislike to make ourselves
needlessly ridiculous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She started to interrupt him; but he gave
her no opportunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was ridiculous. I can fancy how funny
it all must have seemed to you: my meeting
you here without recognizing you, my telling
you over all my regard for my former nurse.
Of course, I must have seemed an ass to you,
and to Mr. Brock and Mr. St. Jacques, too,
after you had told them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time, Nancy did interrupt him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Stop, Mr. Barth!” she said angrily.
“Now you are the one who is unfair. I did
tell Mr. Brock about our adventure at Sainte
Anne-de-Beaupré; but it was when I first
met him, when I had no idea that either of
us would ever see you again. I told the adventure;
but I used no names. You had been
in the house for several days before Mr. Brock
found out that you were my former patient,
and he found it out then from your own lips.
When he told M. St. Jacques, or whether he
told him at all, I am unable to say. I do
know that M. St. Jacques knew it; but, upon
my honor, I have told no one but the Lady
and Mr. Reginald Brock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Bravely, angrily, she raised her eyes to his.
Notwithstanding his former doubts, Barth believed
her implicitly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive my misunderstanding you, then,”
he said simply. “But why couldn’t you have
told me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How could I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry,” she said briefly. “It seemed
to me out of the question.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Even when we were introduced?” he
urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was before that that you had refused to
recognize me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When was that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At the table, the first time you reappeared
here,” she said vindictively. “I did my best
to speak to you then; but you tried to give
me the impression that you had never seen
me before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth bowed in assent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never had. You forget that my glasses
were lost. You should be generous to a near-sighted
man, Miss Howard, as you once were
kind to a cripple. You might have given me
another chance, when we were introduced.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There was nothing to show you cared for
it,” Nancy returned curtly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, even at Sainte Anne, you might have
told me you were coming to Quebec,” he went
on. “You knew I was coming here; you
might have given me the opportunity to call
and thank you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Impatiently Nancy clasped her hands and
unclasped them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the use of arguing about it all?”
she demanded restlessly. “You never could
see the truth of it; no man could. I don’t
want to beg off and make excuses. I have
been in a false position from the start. I
never made it, nor even sought it. It all
came from chance. Still, it has been impossible
for me to get myself out of it; but truly,
Mr. Barth,” she looked up at him appealingly;
“from the first hour I met you at Sainte Anne
until to-day, I have never meant to be disloyal
to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why couldn’t you have told me you
had met me before?” he asked, returning to
his first question with a curious persistency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy fenced with the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, strictly speaking, I had not met you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth’s eyes opened to their widest limit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, really,” he said blankly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; not in any social sense. Nobody
introduced us. I was just your nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly, for the first time since the discovery
of Nancy’s identity, there flashed upon
Barth’s mind the thought of the guinea. He
turned scarlet. Then he rallied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard,” he said slowly, as he took
the chair at her side; “I am not sure you
were the only one who has been placed in a
false position.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl’s irritation vanished, and she
laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About the guinea? Perhaps we can cry
quits, Mr. Barth. Still, your mistake was
justifiable. You took me for a nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. And so you were.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you for the implied compliment.
But, I mean, for a hired nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. I did hire you. At least, I
paid you wa—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In mercy to his later reflections, Nancy cut
him off in the midst of his phrase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps. We knew you wouldn’t let me
do it out of charity, so my father collected his
usual fee in two ways.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth’s glasses had fallen from his nose.
Now, his eyes still on Nancy’s face, he felt
vaguely for the string.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you never received your money?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again the frosty accent came into Nancy’s
tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly not.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, what a beastly shame!” And, seizing
his glasses, Barth stared at her in commiserating
surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a short instant, Nancy longed to tweak
the glasses from his nose. Then she laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As a rule, I don’t nurse people for money,
Mr. Barth,” she said lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? How generous you must be, Miss
Howard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Was there ever a more maddening combination
of manly simplicity and British bigotry,
Nancy reflected impatiently. More and more
she began to despair of making her position
clear. Nevertheless, she went on steadily,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, in fact, you were my one and only
patient.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That you have ever had, in all your
professional life?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I never had any professional life,” Nancy
replied shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth’s face showed his increasing perplexity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you are a nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Nancy answered in flat negation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You nursed me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After a fashion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Nancy’s impatience gave place to
mirth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To cure you, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather! But I didn’t mean that. We
all know it, in fact; and you did it awfully
well. But what made you—er—pick me
out in the first place?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pick you out?” This time, Nancy was
the one to show perplexity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. How did you happen to choose me
for a patient?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy gasped at the new phase of the situation
opened by Barth’s words. In his British
ignorance of American customs, did he think
that she habitually wandered about the country,
selecting attractive strangers to be the
objects of her feminine ministrations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I didn’t choose you,” she said indignantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then, by George, how did you get me?”
Mr. Cecil Barth queried, by this time too
tangled in the web of mystery to select his
words with care.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy blushed; then she frowned; then
she laughed outright.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Barth,” she said at last; “we are
talking in two different languages. If we keep
on, we shall end by needing an interpreter.
This is the whole of my side of the story, so
please listen. I am not a nurse. I am not
anything but just a commonplace American girl
who dances and who eats fish in Lent. My
father is a doctor, and, even in New York, one
knows his name. He came up here to rest
and to gather materials for a monograph on
the miracles of Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré, and
I came with him. I always do go with him.
We had been at Sainte Anne a little more than
a week, when there was a pilgrimage. I had
never seen a pilgrimage, so I went down to
the church. As I was coming out afterwards,
I saw some one fall. No one was near, except
the pilgrim people; and they all lost their
heads and fell to crowding and gesticulating.
I was afraid you would be trodden on; and
my father has always trained me what to do in
emergencies, so I told the people to stand
back. By the time I could get to you, you
had fainted; but I saw you were no pilgrim.
In fact,” Nancy added, with sudden malice;
“I took you for an American.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth winced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am sure you were very kind,” he
protested hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad you think so. Well, you know
the rest of the story.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth rose and stood facing her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he objected. “That is exactly what I
do not know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How you were taken to the Gagnier
farm?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How you became my nurse,” he persisted
quietly. “Please don’t leave that out of your
story, Miss Howard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was sheer necessity, Mr. Barth. You
said you spoke no French; neither did I.
You were suffering and in need of a doctor
at once. I knew of no doctor there but my
father, and you assented to my suggestion of
him. He will tell you that your ankle was in
a bad condition and needed constant care. I
knew he was not strong enough to give it, and
I telegraphed all over Quebec in a vain search
for a nurse. I couldn’t get one; neither, for
the sake of a few conventions, could I let you
end your days with a stiff ankle. There was
only one thing to be done, and I did it.” She
stopped for a moment. Then she added, “I
only hope I may not have done it too clumsily.
It was new work for me, Mr. Barth; but I did
the very best I could.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In her earnest self-justification, she sat looking
up at Barth with the unconscious eyes of a
child. Barth held out his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard, you must have thought me
an awful cad,” he said contritely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I did, at first; but now I know better,” she
answered honestly. “There was no real reason
you should have known I was not an hireling.
At first, I resented it, though. I resented it
again, when you came here and didn’t recognize
me. It seemed to me impossible that you
could have spent ten days with me, and forgotten
me so completely. It wasn’t flattering
to my vanity, Mr. Barth; and I only gained
my lost self-respect when you informed me,
the other day, that you were still hoping to
meet me again.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He echoed her laugh; but his tone was a
little eager, as he added,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And that, in my secret thoughts, I used to
call you my Good Sainte Anne?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never that, I fear,” she answered lightly.
“The Good Sainte Anne works miracles, Mr.
Barth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” he said slowly. “I know she
does. But sometimes the surest miracles are
the slowest to reach their full perfection.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And there are many pilgrims to her shrine
who go away again without having beheld a
miracle,” she reminded him, still with the same
lightness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, rather!” he answered gravely. “Still,
do you know, Miss Howard, I may be the one
exception who proves the rule.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“And what next?” Brock inquired, the
next morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Market,” Nancy replied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To spend your guinea?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hush!” she bade him, with a startled
glance over her shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, you needn’t worry. Barth never gets
around till the fifty-ninth minute. He’ll wait
until the last trump sounds, before he orders
his ascension robe, and then he’ll tip Saint
Peter to hold the gate open while he puts it
on. But what about the market?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going with the Lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To carry the basket?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I’ll leave that for you,” Nancy
retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A sudden iniquitous idea shot athwart
Brock’s brain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very well. What time do you start?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At ten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right, oh! I’ll be on hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An equally iniquitous idea entered Nancy’s
head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have you ever been to market?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you want to go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we can count on you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Ten o’clock sharp. If I’m not
there, I’ll agree to send a substitute. But
count on me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>When they went their separate ways from
breakfast, Brock sought the town house of the
Duke of Kent; but Nancy went in search of
the Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you going to take Tommy to carry
the basket?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. He always goes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And will the basket be very huge?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good!” Nancy said, laughing. “I am
glad, for we are going to leave Tommy at
home, to-day, and take Mr. Brock in his
place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nancy!” the Lady remonstrated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He insisted upon being invited,” Nancy
returned obdurately; “and, if he does go, he
must be made useful. We sha’n’t need both
him and Tommy; Mr. Brock wants to carry
the basket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock, meanwhile, had left the maid standing
in the lower hallway and, two steps at a
time, was mounting the ducal staircase which
led to Barth’s room. His fist, descending upon
the panels, cleft the Englishman’s dream in two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. What is it? Wait a bit, and
I’ll let you in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the other side of the door, muffled
sounds betrayed the fact that Barth was struggling
with his dressing-gown and slippers.
Then the door was flung open, and Barth stood
on the threshold. He started back in astonishment,
as he caught sight of his unexpected
guest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh. Mr. Brock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Sorry to have routed you out so
early; but I came to bring you word from
Miss Howard and the Lady.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth stepped away from the doorway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come in,” he said hospitably. “Excuse
the look of the place, though.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock’s keen eyes swept the room with
direct, impersonal curiosity, took note of the
half-unpacked boxes, the piles of books, the
heaps of clothing, then moved back to Barth’s
face, where they rested with mirthful, kindly
scrutiny. Then he crossed the room and
dropped into a chair by the window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You brought me a message from Miss
Howard?” Barth queried tentatively, after a
pause which his companion seemed disinclined
to break.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so much a message as a—a suggestion,”
Brock answered, with a hesitation so
short as to escape the Englishman’s ear.
“Miss Howard and the Lady are going to
market, this morning, and I gathered, from
what Miss Howard said, that she would like
you to be on hand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To—market?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. She evidently thought you understood
it was an engagement. The only question
seemed to be about the hour.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh. What time do they go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ten.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is past nine now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth stepped to the table and glanced at
his watch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fifteen past nine,” he read. “There is
plenty of time. And you are sure Miss
Howard wanted me?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perfectly,” Brock answered, with brazen
mendacity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How strange!” observed Mr. Cecil Barth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange that she should want you? Oh,
not at all,” Brock demurred politely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. Strange that she shouldn’t have
mentioned it before.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t she say anything about it, last
night?” Brock inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. At least, I don’t remember it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It may have slipped her mind. You had
a good deal to talk over, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do people do, when they go to
market?” Barth queried, with sudden and intentional
inconsequence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buy things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But what sort of things?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Haven’t you been down into the market
yet?” Brock asked, as he craned his neck
to watch two girls passing in the street
beneath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. Why should I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strangers generally do; it is quite one of
the sights.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you mind if I begin dressing, Mr.
Brock? What sort of sights?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, cabbages, and pigs, and country
things like that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth’s brows knotted, partly over his
dressing, partly over his effort to grasp the
situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is Miss Howard going down to—to
look at those things?” he inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, man; of course not. She is going
down with the Lady to buy them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To—buy—a pig?” Barth spoke in
three detached sentences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock smothered his merriment according
to the best of his ability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The Lady will do the buying. Miss
Howard goes to look on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And does she expect me to look on,
too?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth sat with his shoe horn hanging loosely
in his hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Mr. Brock, I don’t know a bad pig
from a good one,” he protested hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, it’s quite easy to tell. Just pinch
him a bit about the ribs. If he is fat and
squeals nicely, he’ll go. But, as I understand
it, you aren’t to do the marketing. You are
expected to carry the basket for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth looked up from his second shoe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The basket?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Women here take their baskets
with them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And get them filled?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Surely. Then they bring them home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth finished the tying of his shoestrings.
Then he rose and picked up his collar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, really!” he remonstrated, as he
fumbled with the buttonholes. “Miss Howard
can’t be expecting that I am going to bring
a pig home in my arms.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock rose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is never safe to predict what a pretty
woman will expect next,” he said oracularly.
“I usually make a point of being ready for
almost anything. As far as Miss Howard is
concerned, I’d rather carry a pig for her than
a bunch of roses for some women.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time, Brock’s words rang true. Moreover,
they dismissed any doubts lingering in
the mind of his companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, rather!” he assented, with some enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A mocking light came into Brock’s clear
eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad you agree with me. You knew
her before I did, I believe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. At Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré. Miss
Howard was very good to me, when I was
there.” Over the top of his half-fastened collar,
Barth spoke with simple dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock liked the tone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can imagine it, Barth,” he answered, with
a sudden wave of liking for the loyal little
Englishman before him. “Both St. Jacques
and I would gladly have offered up our ankles
at the shrine of Sainte Anne, for such a chance
as yours.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What kind of a chance do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Chance to be coddled by Miss Howard, of
course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth slid the string of his glasses over his
head, put on his glasses and looked steadily up
at Brock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was a chance,” he assented gravely.
“Chance and the handiwork of the Good
Sainte Anne. It might have meant a good
deal to me. Instead, I threw it all away by my
own dulness; and now, instead of having the
advantage of a three-weeks’ acquaintance, I
have to start at the very beginning once more.
If, as you are hinting, you and Mr. St. Jacques
and I are on a strife to win the regard of Miss
Howard, you and Mr. St. Jacques have already
distanced me in the race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock laughed; but his eyes had grown
surprisingly gentle. In all his easy-going life,
a life when friends and their confidences
had been his for the asking, few things had
touched him as did this direct, simple expression
of trust on the part of Mr. Cecil Barth.
Contrary to his custom, he met confidence
with confidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re a good fellow, Barth,” he said
heartily. “I am a little out of the running,
myself. I’d like to wish you success, if I
could; but St. Jacques is the older friend.”
Then, relenting, he recurred to the object of
his call. “Now see here, Barth,” he added;
“you needn’t feel obliged to go to market.
There may be some joke in the matter. Miss
Howard laughed, when she was talking about
it. Don’t go, if you don’t wish to. They
can take Tommy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but I’d like to go,” Barth interposed
hurriedly, as he looked at his watch. “It is
past ten now, Mr. Brock. May I ask you to
excuse me?” And, without waiting for a final
word from Brock, he turned and went dashing
down the staircase at a speed which boded
little good for an invalid ankle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten o’clock, that sunny morning, found
Champlain Market the centre of an eager,
jostling, basket-laden throng. As a rule, the
Lady sought her purchases at the market just
outside the Saint John Gate. To-day, however,
she had elected to go to the Lower Town,
and, true to an old engagement, Nancy had
elected to go with her. It was a novel experience
for the girl, and she wandered up and
down at the heels of the Lady, now staring at
the stout old habitant women who, since early
dawn, had sat wedged into their packed carts,
knitting away as comfortably as if they had
been surrounded by sofa pillows rather than
by pumpkins; at the round-faced, bundled-up
children who guarded the stalls of belated
flowers, of blue-yarn socks and of baskets of
every size; at the groups of men, gathered here
and there in the throng, offering to their possible
customers the choice between squealing pigs
and squawking fowls which one and all seemed
to be resenting the liberties taken with their
breast-bones. Back of the old stone market
building, the carts were drawn up in long lines;
and the board platforms between were heaped
with cabbages and paved with crates. At the
north, the little gray spire of Notre Dame des
Victoires guarded the square where, for over
two hundred years, it had done honor to the
name of Our Lady and to the memory of successive
victories won, by her protecting care,
over invading foes. Above it all, the black-faced
cannon poked its sullen nose over the
wall of the King’s Bastion where, a scarlet
patch against the sky, there fluttered the threefold
cross of the Union Jack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And still Brock failed to appear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just like a man!” Nancy said impatiently,
as the half-hour struck. “You are sure Mary
understood the message?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She never forgets. I was sorry not to wait,
Nancy; but we should have lost our chance to
get anything good. We are late, as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Late! What time does the market
open?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By five o’clock. These people have been
coming in, all night long. By five in the morning,
the place is full of customers. It is worth
the seeing then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy shivered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Uh! Not at this season of the year. I
am not fond of the clammy dawn; and, down
here by the river, it must be deathly. But, in
the meanwhile,—” Again she glanced towards
the corner of Little Champlain Street.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is no use, Nancy. You are caught in
your own trap, and now you must either go
home and send Tommy to me, or else help
me to carry home the basket.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t mind the basket, though I confess
I wish I hadn’t urged you to bring your very
largest one. But I am disappointed in Mr.
Brock. I thought he possessed more invention
than this. He made me believe he had
some mischief lurking in his brain; and it is
very flat and boyish merely to promise to
appear and then not to materialize.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He may have been prevented, at the last
minute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then,” Nancy responded grimly; “he’d
much better have kept to the letter of his
promise and sent a substitute.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was still wandering aimlessly to and fro
among the crowd, now jostled by a packed
basket on the arm of a sturdy habitant, now
whacked on the ankle by a hen dangling
limply, head downward, from the hand of the
habitant’s wife, now pausing to bargain for a
bunch of pale violet sweet peas or a tiny
replica of one of the melon-shaped baskets so
characteristic of the town. All at once, she
turned to the Lady.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If there isn’t Mr. Barth!” she exclaimed,
lapsing, in her surprise, into the unmistakable
vernacular of The States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Lady was deeply absorbed in her final
purchase of the day, which, as it chanced, was
a piglet for the morrow’s dinner. Engrossed
in the relative merits of a whole series of piglets
of varying dimension, she was deaf to
Nancy’s words. Left to herself, the girl met
Barth with an eager smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it peace, or war?” she asked merrily,
as she gave him her hand, sweet peas and
all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Peace, of course. Are the flowers a token
of the treaty?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you want them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, rather!” And Barth pulled off his
glove to fasten them into the lapel of his dark
blue coat. “I am so sorry to be late, Miss
Howard; but Mr. Brock stopped a little, to
talk.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have seen Mr. Brock, this morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. He was in my room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s face betrayed her surprise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And did he say anything about market?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He told me you were coming at ten. I
meant to be on hand; but he delayed me, and,
when I finally started, I missed my way and
came out over by the custom house. I must
have taken a wrong turning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps. But where is Mr. Brock?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think he went to his office.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a little pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jolly crowd, this,” Barth commented at
length. “Where is the Lady?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Over there.” Nancy pointed to the Lady,
still bending over the crate of piglets.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh. And those are the pigs? Oughtn’t
we to go across and help her?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am afraid I’m not a judge of them,” she
demurred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth’s voice dropped confidentially.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither am I. Still, as long as I came to
help her, I think it would be rather decent to
see if I can do anything about it, now I am
here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” Nancy said blankly. “Was the
Lady expecting you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth’s gratified smile completed her mystification.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, rather! I wouldn’t have felt at
liberty without, you know. That’s what the
Lady is for.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A moment later, the Lady started in surprise.
Stick and gloves in hand and a frown of deep
consideration on his boyish brow, Barth suddenly
knelt down at her side and shut his slim
fingers upon the flank of the nearest piglet,
which gave vocal expression to its displeasure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh. Good morning,” he added, not
to the piglet, however, but to the Lady. “I
think you will find this little chap quite
satisfactory.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant, Nancy had difficulty in repressing
her mirth. Then, from the Lady’s
manifest astonishment at Barth’s appearing,
from Barth’s own manner, and from her memory
of Brock’s final words, she saw the hand of the
young Canadian in the situation. This was
the substitute whom Brock had promised. She
determined to put her theory to the test.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Brock was very good to act as our
messenger,” she suggested craftily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather! He is a good fellow, anyway,”
Barth answered, as he rose and dusted off his
knees. “I like the English Canadians, myself.
They are a grade above the French ones.
But, do you know, Mr. Brock only just saved
me from disgracing myself again. I was so
absorbed in—in the other things we talked
over, last night, that I quite forgot about the
trip to market, this morning.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a minute, as she looked into Barth’s
animated face, Nancy waxed hot with indignation
over Brock’s childish trick. She half
resolved to warn the young Englishman against
the species of hazing which he was called upon
to undergo. Then she held her peace. Her
warnings would count for more, if she levelled
them at Brock, rather than at Brock’s victim.
Even her limited experience of Barth had
assured her that, in certain directions, his understanding
was finite. It would never occur
to his insular mind that his very naïveté would
make him a more tempting prey to the jovial
young Canadian.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never mind, as long as you came at all,
Mr. Barth,” she replied lightly. “It would
have been a pity for you to have missed the
sight. We couldn’t very well wait for you,
because the Lady had to come on business,
not pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And is this all?” Barth said, as the
Lady turned from the piglet. “Where is
the basket?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There.” And Nancy, as she pointed to
the heaped assortment of garden stuffs, suddenly
resolved to put Barth’s chivalry to the
test.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The test was weighty, unlovely of outline and
unsavory of odor; nevertheless, the young Britisher
did not shrink. Without a glance around
him, Mr. Cecil Barth bent over the great
basket and passed its handles over the curve
of his elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we go home by the steps?” he asked.
“Or do you take the lift?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the Lady interfered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I go to the nearest cab-stand,” she replied
promptly. “I find I must dash over to the
other market as fast as I can go. There are
cabs just around the corner, Mr. Barth, if you
are willing to put my basket into one. Then,
if you and Miss Howard will excuse me for
deserting the expedition, I will leave you to
walk home together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Nancy’s answering smile assured the
Lady of her full forgiveness.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“I love all things British, saving and excepting
their manners and their mortar,”
Nancy soliloquized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s temper was ruffled, that morning.
As she had left the table, Barth had followed
her to the parlor where, apparently apropos of
an inoffensive Frenchman crossing the Place
d’Armes, he had been drawn into strictures
concerning American and French peculiarities
of speech and manner. The talk had been impersonal;
nevertheless, Nancy had been quick
to discern that its text lay in the growing friendship
between herself and St. Jacques. For a
time, she had listened in silence to the Britisher’s
accusing monologue. Then her temper
had given way completely. Flapping the
American flag full in his face, she had loosed
the American eagle and promptly routed Barth
and driven him from the field, with the British
Lion trudging dejectedly at his heels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I want him to understand that he’s not to
say <span class='it'>American</span> to me, in any such tone as that!”
Nancy muttered vindictively, as she pinned on
her hat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then she went out to walk herself into a
good temper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The good temper was still conspicuous by
its absence, when, regardless of appearances,
she dropped down in the grass by the hospital
gate, and fell to picking the scraps of mortar
out of the meshes of her rough cloth gown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I believe I am all kinds of an idiot,” she
continued to herself explosively. “First, Joe’s
letter rubbed me the wrong way. I don’t see
how he could be so stupid as to imagine I’m
homesick. Of course, I am glad he is coming
up here; but an extra man, in any relation,
does have a tendency to complicate things.
And then Mr. Brock didn’t come to breakfast.
I know he was cross, last night, because
I took Mr. Barth’s part. And now Mr. Barth
has made me lose my temper again. I believe
he does it, just for the sake of seeing me abase
myself afterwards. Dear me! Everybody is
cross, and I am the crossest of the lot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beside her on the grass, the shadow of the
Union Jack above the hospital moved idly to
and fro. Behind her was the low, squat bulk
of the third Martello Tower whose crumbling
mortar Nancy was even now removing from
her clothing. The fourth Martello Tower,
hidden somewhere within the dingy confines of
Saint Sauveur, had eluded all her efforts to find
it; the other two had been too obviously converted
to twentieth-century purposes. This
had looked more inviting, and Nancy had
spent a chilly hour in its depths. By turning
her back upon the dripping icehouse in its
southern edge, and focussing her mind upon
the mammoth central column which supported
its arching roof, she had been able to force herself
backward into the days when a Martello
Tower was a thing for an invading army to
reckon with. In the magazine beneath, the
drip from the icehouse had spoiled the illusion;
but the open platform above, albeit now snugly
roofed in, still offered its battlements and its
trio of dismounted cannon to her cynical gaze.
Nancy left the dim interior, bored, but sternly
just. In some moods and with certain companions,
even the third Martello Tower might
be interesting. Meantime, she was conscious
of a distinct wish that the relics of the crumbling
past might not have such marked affinity
for her shoulder-blades.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She looked up. Cap in hand, St. Jacques
was standing before her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad I have found you,” he added
directly. “I was wishing that something good
might happen.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s smile broadened to a laugh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you cross, too?” she queried, without
troubling herself to rise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Very,” St. Jacques assented briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am so glad. Let’s be cross together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Frenchman shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t like the place. The associations
are not pleasant.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see why. It looks a very comfortable
place to be ill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but who wants to think of being
ill?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nobody,” Nancy returned philosophically.
“Still, now and then we must, you know.
Witness Mr. Barth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. But even Mr. Barth had a good
nurse.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be too sure of that. Even my level
best is none too even,” Nancy replied enigmatically,
with scant consideration for the alien
tongue of her companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He ignored her words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I should be ill, would you take care of
me?” he asked suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still laughing, the girl shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Never. I like you altogether too well,
M. St. Jacques, to risk your life with my ministrations.
Instead of that, though, I will come
out here to see you as often as you will grant
me admission.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not here. They would never grant me
admission in the first place,” St. Jacques responded
dryly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I am Catholic.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how paltry!” Nancy burst out in
hot indignation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is true, however.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a sweep of her arm, Nancy pointed to
the Union Jack whose scarlet folds stained the
sky line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the sooner they pull that down, the
better,” she said scornfully. “I thought that
the British flag stood for religious freedom.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you are not Catholic,” St. Jacques said
slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What difference does that make? I am
not a Seven-Day Baptist, either. Neither fact
makes me ignore the rights of my friends
who are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques still stood looking down at her.
His face was unusually grave, that morning;
and it seemed to Nancy that his swarthy
cheeks were flushed more than it was their
wont to be.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have friends who are Catholics?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One, I hope,” she answered quietly.
Then she rose to her feet. “What are you
doing out here at this hour?” she added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Walking, to tire myself,” he answered.
“Will you come?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For her only answer, she dropped into step
at his side, and they turned down the steep
slope leading into Saint Sauveur, crossed
Saint Roch and the Dorchester Bridge and
came out on the open road to Beauport.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never a garrulous companion, St. Jacques
was more silent than ever, that morning, and
Nancy let him have his way. Moreover, at
times she was conscious of something restful
in the long pauses which came in her talk with
St. Jacques. When he chose, the young
Frenchman spoke easily and well. Apparently,
however, he saw no need of talking, unless
he had something to say. In their broken
talk and their long silences, Nancy had gained
a better understanding of St. Jacques, a more
perfect sympathy with his point of view and
his mood than she had gained of Brock in all
their hours of chattering intercourse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a long mile, they walked on without
speaking. Shoulder to shoulder, they had
gone tramping along the narrow plank walk
with the sure rhythm of perfectly adapted step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How well we walk together!” Nancy
said, suddenly breaking the silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” St. Jacques assented briefly. “I
have always noticed it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some men would have used her random
words as the theme for a sentimental speech.
To St. Jacques, they were too obvious; emotion
should not be wasted upon anything so
matter of fact. Long since, Nancy had become
accustomed to that phase of his mind.
It gave a certain restfulness to their intercourse
to know that St. Jacques would never read
unintended meanings into her simplest utterances.
At first, she had supposed him too
stolid, too earnestly intent upon his own ends
to waste sentiment upon herself. Lately, she
had begun to doubt; and she confessed to herself
that the doubt was sweet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said you were cross, to-day?” St.
Jacques broke the silence, this time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, detestably.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For any especial reason?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How uncomplimentary of you to suggest
that I am ever cross without reason!” Nancy
rebuked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is the reason?” he asked coolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are several of them, all tangled up
together.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, as usual, Barth is one of them,” St.
Jacques supplemented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps; and Mr. Brock is another,”
Nancy replied unexpectedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Brock? What has he done?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing. I did it. At least, I tried to
lecture him for playing tricks on Mr. Barth,
and—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One is always at liberty to play tricks with
a monkey,” St. Jacques interpolated quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Barth isn’t a monkey,” Nancy retorted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No? Then what is he?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The best little Englishman that ever lived,”
she answered promptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The lower lip of St. Jacques rolled out into
his odd little smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the game surely ought to be in the
hands of the French,” he responded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’re not fair to Mr. Barth,” Nancy said,
as she stooped to pull off a spray of scarlet
maple leaves from a bush at her feet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps not. Neither are you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I am. He hasn’t a more loyal friend
in America, M. St. Jacques.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I know that. It is not always fair to be
too loyal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it makes one wonder whether the
game is worth the candle,” the Frenchman
replied imperturbably. “One doesn’t fly to
defend the strongest spot on the city wall.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy looked up into his dark face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; and, in the same way, I’ve not
fought a battle in your behalf since we met.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At least—” she added hurriedly, as she
recalled stray sentences of her talk with Barth,
that morning. “But in a way you have told
the truth. I have fought Mr. Barth’s battles
with you all, until I sometimes feel as if I were
wholly responsible for the man.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then why not let him fight his own
battles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A torn red leaf fluttered from Nancy’s fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because he won’t. It’s not that he is a
coward; it’s not that he is conceited or too
sure of himself. It is only that he is like a
great, overgrown child who never stops to think
of the impression he is making. Sometimes it
is refreshing; sometimes it makes one long to
box him up and send him back to be tethered
out on a chain attached to Westminster Abbey.
Even that wouldn’t do, though, for the Poets’
Corner has made room for an American or two.
Mr. Barth is queer and innocent and, just now
and then, superlatively stupid. And yet, M.
St. Jacques, I don’t believe he ever had an
ignoble idea from the day of his birth up to
to-day. He is absolutely generous and high-minded,
and one can forgive a good deal for
the sake of that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Flushed with her eager championship, she
paused and smiled up into her companion’s
eves. His answering smile drove the gravity
from his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he assented; “and, from your very
persistence, you imply that there is a good deal
to forgive.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Something, perhaps,” she assented in her
turn; “but it is largely negative. Meanwhile,
he isn’t fair game for you and Mr. Brock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because he believes everything you tell
him; because it never once enters his mind
that you would find it worth your while to torment
him. If he lets you alone, he expects
you to do the same by him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques made no answer. With his dark
eyes fixed on the broad river at his right hand,
he marched steadily along by Nancy’s side until
the quaint little roadside cross of temperance
was far behind them. Then he said abruptly,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard, I wish I knew just how
well you like that fellow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s thoughts, like her steps, had lain
parallel to his. She responded now without
hesitation,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I knew, myself; but I don’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant, St. Jacques removed his eyes
from the river. He smiled, as he moved them
back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s next words showed that her mind
had taken a backward leap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You said you were walking to tire yourself?”
she said interrogatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. Am I also tiring you?” St. Jacques
answered, with instant courtesy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I always dislike the turning around
to go home by the same road.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then we can walk on to Beauport church,
and take the tram back,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As you like,” she agreed. “But why tire
yourself?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The thin, firm lips shut into a resolute line.
Then St. Jacques replied briefly,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have been lying awake too much for my
pleasure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thinking of your sins?” Nancy asked
gayly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, and of some other things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Pleasant things, I hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Frenchman’s brows contracted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have had dreams that were pleasanter.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy stole a sidelong glance at him, saw
the expression in his eyes, and, turning, looked
him full in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M. St. Jacques,” she said quietly; “something
is wrong.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled, as he shook his head; but his
eyes did not light.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no use of denying it. I have
been a nurse, you know,” she persisted laughingly;
“and I have learned to watch for symptoms.
Men don’t frown like that and beetle
their brows, without some cause or other. Does
something worry you; or aren’t you feeling
well?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without breaking his even pace, St. Jacques
turned and looked steadily into her earnest,
sympathetic face. This time, his dark eyes
lighted in response to the friendly look in her
own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps it may be a little of both,” he answered
quietly. “Even then, there is no reason
one should be a worry to one’s friends.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The pause which followed was a short one.
Then St. Jacques roused himself and laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really, Miss Howard,” he added, as he
brushed his thick hair backward from the
scarlet gash in his forehead; “it is only that
I started with headache, this morning. I was
too dull for work; but either Nurse Howard
or the Good Sainte Anne has made me forget
it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Nancy smiled back at him in token of
perfect understanding. She had not heard his
last inaudible words,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Or perhaps it may be the work of good
Saint Joseph.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In fact, Nancy Howard as yet had gained
no inkling of the especial attributes of Saint
Joseph, nor did she suspect the part that the
good old saint was beginning to play in the
coming events of her life. To Nancy’s mind,
May was always May. So long as it lasted,
there was no reason for looking forward into the
coming month of June. The future tense was
created solely for those whose present was not
absolutely good.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Confronted by a tea-tray and a Britisher
in combination, Nancy Howard
was conscious of a certain abashment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At home in New York, she was accustomed
to administer informal tea by means of a silver
ball and a spirit lamp. These two diminutive
pots, the one of water and the other of tea, left
her in a blissful state of uncertainty whether
she was to measure them out, half and half, or,
emptying the teapot at the first round, fill it
up with the water in the hopes of decocting a
feeble second cup. Moreover, Nancy preferred
lemon in her tea, and, worst of all, there were
no sugar tongs. Nancy wondered vaguely
whether Englishwomen were wont to make
tea in brand-new gloves, or whether Englishmen
were less finical than their transatlantic
brethren.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth, his glasses on his nose, watched her
intently. His very intentness increased her
abashment. It had been at his suggestion that
they had gone to the little tea shop, that afternoon,
and Nancy had no wish to bring disgrace
either upon Barth or herself, in the presence
of those of Quebec’s fair daughters who, at
the tables around them, were sipping tea and
gossip by turns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Devoutly praying that she might not upset
the cream jug, nor forget to call the sugarbowl
a <span class='it'>basin</span>, Nancy at last succeeded in filling
Barth’s cup.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How scriptural!” he observed, as he took
it from her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“In what way?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pointed to the pale ring of overflow in
the saucer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It runneth over,” he quoted gravely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy developed a literal turn of mind.
She did it now and then; it was always unexpected,
and it left her companion of the
moment in the conversational lurch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That means happiness, not tea,” she said
calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth looked at her inquiringly. Then,
with unwonted swiftness, he rallied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes the two are synonymous,” he
said quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nancy turned wayward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not when they are watered down. But
you must admit that Americans give good
measure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth smiled across the table at her, in
manifest content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of both,” he asserted, as he stirred his
tea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have a biscuit,” Nancy advised him
suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A—Would you like me to order some?
I dare say they have them out there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy rested her elbows on the table with
a protesting bump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There you go Britishing me again!” she
said hotly. “You said you wouldn’t do it.
Even if I am an American, I do know enough
not to say <span class='it'>cracker</span>. That was one of the few
lessons I learned at my mother’s knee. But
there aren’t any cracker-biscuits here. I was
referring to these others.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth glanced anxiously about the table.
Aside from the tray, there were two plates upon
the table, and one of the two held tiny strips of
toasted bread. All told, there were exactly
eight of the strips, each amounting to a mouthful
and a half, and Nancy had just been out at
the Cove Fields, playing golf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy pointed to the other plate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I mean those—biscuits,” she said conclusively
and with emphasis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Those? Oh. But those aren’t biscuits.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you call them, then? Buns?”
Nancy inquired, with scathing curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Buns? Oh, no. Those are scones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time, Nancy fairly bounced in her
chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are nothing in this world but common,
every-day American soda biscuits,” she
said, as she helped herself to the puffiest and
the brownest. “You are in America now,
Mr. Barth, and there is no sense in your putting
British names to our cooking. Will you
have a biscuit?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. But really, you know, they are
scones,” he protested. “My mother nearly
always has them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy cast anxious eyes at the drop of
molten butter that was trickling along the base
of her thumb.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so do we,” she replied firmly; “only
we eat them at breakfast, with a napkin. I
don’t mean that we actually eat the napkin,”
she explained hastily, in mercy for the limitations
of her companion’s understanding. “But,
really, these are very buttery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth sucked his forefinger with evident
relish.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, rather!” he assented. “That’s what
makes them so good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy furtively rescued her handkerchief
from her temporary substitute for a pocket.
Then, bending forward, she arranged four of
the strips of toast around the margin of her
saucer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s that for?” Barth queried, at a loss
to know whether the act was another Americanism,
or merely a Nancyism pure and simple.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are going to go halves on our rations,”
Nancy answered coolly. “I am just as hungry
as you are, and I don’t propose to have you
eating more than your share of things.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Would you like to have me order some
more scones?” he asked courteously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the space of a full minute, Nancy bestowed
her entire attention upon her teacup.
Then she lifted the white of one eye to Barth’s
questioning face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, rather!” she responded nonchalantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the tables around them, Quebec’s fair
daughters paused in their tea and their gossip
to cast a questioning glance in the direction of
Barth’s mirth. As a rule, masculine mirth had
scant place in the cosy little tea shop. In summer,
it was visited by a procession of American
tourists who imbibed its tea in much the
same solemn spirit as they breathed the incense
of the Basilica, inhaled the crisp breeze
over Cape Diamond and tasted the vigorous
brew that ripened in the vaults of the old intendant’s
palace. When the tourists had betaken
themselves southward and Quebec once
more began to resume its customary life, the
shop became a purely feminine function. It
was an ideal place for a dish of gossip in the
autumnal twilight. The walls hung thick with
ancient plates and mirrors, venerable teapots
and jugs stood in serried ranks along the shelf
about the top of the room, and a quaint assortment
of rugs nearly covered the floor. Here
and there about the wide room were scattered
little claw-footed tables whose shiny tops were
covered with squares of homespun linen,
brown and soft as a bit of Indian pongee.
Not even the blazing electric lights could give
an air of modernness to the place, and Nancy,
in the intervals of her struggles with the tray,
looked about her with complete content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth possessed certain of the attributes of
a successful general. Wide experience had
taught him to administer fees freely and, as a
rule, with exceeding discretion. As a result,
he and Nancy were in possession of the most
desirable table in the room, close beside the
deep casement overlooking Saint Louis Street.
Nancy, the light falling full on her eager face,
over her radiant hair and on her dark cloth
gown, could watch at her will the loitering
passers in the street beneath, or the idle groups
at the tables around her. Barth, his own face
in shadow, could see but one thing. That one
thing, however, was quite enough, for it was
Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>More than a week had passed since the
morning in the market. To Mr. Cecil Barth,
the week had seemed like a year, and yet
shorter than many a single day of his past experience.
Their walk homeward from the
market had been by way of Saint Roch and
the old French fortifications, and their conversation
had been as devious as their path.
Nevertheless, Barth, as he sat in his room applying
liniment and red flannel to his aching
ankle, felt that they had been moving straight
towards a perfect understanding and good-fellowship.
He had left Nancy, the night before,
convinced of her generosity, but equally
convinced that the worst hour of his life had
been the hour when he took the train for
Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré. Now, as he meditatively
contemplated the pool of liniment on
the carpet at his feet, he acknowledged to himself
that the Good Sainte Anne had wrought a
mighty series of miracles in his behalf, and he
offered up a prayer, as devout as it was incoherent,
that she might not remove her favor until
she had wrought the mightiest miracle of all.
Then, his prayer ended and his ankle anointed,
he fell to whistling contentedly to himself as
he tied up his shoe and brushed his yellow
hair in preparation for dinner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as possible, for the next week, he
had been a fixture at Nancy’s side. As yet,
much walking was out of the question for
him; but, within the narrow limits of the city
wall, or under the roof of The Maple Leaf,
neither Brock nor St. Jacques were able to
sever him from his self-imposed connection
with Nancy’s apron string. He took small
part in the conversation; with Brock, at least,
he manifested a complete indifference to the
course of events. It was merely that he was
there, and that there he meant to stay, filling
in the hiatuses of Nancy’s time, answering her
lightest appeals for attention and now and
then adding a pithy word of support to even
her most wayward opinions. It was not the
first time that an invading British force had
encamped about a fortress at Quebec. Wolfe
at the head of his army showed no more gritty
determination to win than did that quiet,
simple-minded Britisher, Mr. Cecil Barth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, as the October days crept by, Nancy
Howard grew increasingly nervous, St. Jacques
increasingly annoyed, and Reginald Brock increasingly
amused at the whole situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That morning, Barth had sat for a long
hour, staring thoughtfully at the yellow-striped
paper of his room, while he pondered
the entire case. One by one, he passed over
the events of the past six weeks in detailed review.
He recalled those first days in Quebec,
when his one idea had been to avoid the unsought
society of the whole cordial American
tribe. He bethought himself contentedly of
his first aversion for Adolphe St. Jacques,
which had been coördinate, in point of time,
with his introduction to the dining-room of
The Maple Leaf. He remembered the sunshiny
morning which, following on the heels
of a week of drizzle, had lured him forth to
Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré and to his ultimate
destruction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Up to that time, his memories were orderly
and logical. From that point onward, they
fell into chaos. Days of grinding pain and
intense dreariness were lightened by the sound
of Nancy’s low voice and the touch of Nancy’s
firm, supple fingers upon his injured foot.
True, she had been an American; but, even at
that early stage of his experience, it had begun
to dawn upon Mr. Cecil Barth that, under
proper conditions and in their proper places,
Americans might have certain pleasing attributes.
Then Nancy had left him. In the
lonely days which followed, Barth had acknowledged
to himself that, for Americans of a
proper type, the proper conditions and the
proper places bore direct connection with his
own individual bottle of liniment. The acknowledgment
was reached in the midst of
his own efforts to establish relations with his
own ankle which, all at once, seemed to him
peculiarly remote and elusive. And then?
Then he had returned to The Maple Leaf,
and had found Nancy there, and she was the
same Nancy, and there was a very jolly little
tea shop in Saint Louis Street. At that point
in his musings, Mr. Cecil Barth had seized his
cap and rushed down the stairs of his ducal
home.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only once, as he was crossing through the
Ring, did it occur to his mind, as a possible
factor in the case, that, though a younger son,
his departure for America had been attended
by the wailing of a large chorus of mothers.
Even then, he dismissed the thought as unworthy
of Nancy and of himself. Details
of that kind entered into the present situation
not at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Fate was all in his favor, that morning. He
found Nancy quite alone, and, as a result of
his finding her, Nancy had been confronted
by the tea-tray and the Britisher in combination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see what you are laughing at,” she
said plaintively, in answer to Barth’s merriment.
“I am only trying to make my meaning
unmistakable to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth laughed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, in time you would make a fairly good
Englishwoman,” he said reassuringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only Nancy’s super-acute ear could have
discovered the note of condescension in his
voice. She set down her teacup with a
thump.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you; but I have no aspirations in
that direction,” she responded shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How strange!” Barth observed, as he
took another scone, opened it and peered in to
see which was the more buttery side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t see anything strange at all,” Nancy
argued. “Who wants to be English?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth shut up the scone like a box, and laid
it down on the edge of his saucer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, you are. You ought to be satisfied.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In hot haste, Barth felt about for his glasses;
but they were tangled in his buttons, and he
missed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, rather!” he assented hurriedly. “Do
have another scone.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Notwithstanding her indignation, Nancy
laughed. Barth’s accent was so like that of an
elderly uncle bribing a naughty child to goodness
by means of a stick of candy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, I always like hot biscuits,”
she assented. Then, for the second time, she
put her elbows on the table and sat resting her
chin upon her clasped hands. “Mr. Barth,”
she said meditatively; “has it ever occurred to
you that I may possibly be proud of having
been born an American?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth peered up at her in near-sighted
curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” he answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s eyes were fixed thoughtfully upon
him, taking in every detail of his earnest face,
honest and boyish, and likable withal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” she reiterated slowly; “I am.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you wouldn’t rather be English, if
you could?” Barth queried, with an eagerness
for which she was at a loss to account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. Why should I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sat looking steadily at her, while the
scarlet color mounted across his cheeks and
brow. Then even Nancy’s ears could not fail
to distinguish the minor cadence in his voice,
as he said, in slow regret,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—I am sorry. I really can’t see why.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“And still,” Dr. Howard added cheerily;
“I wouldn’t give up hope yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolphe St. Jacques turned from a listless
contemplation of the habitant in the courtyard,
and looked the doctor full in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You think—?” he said interrogatively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor’s nod was plainly reluctant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but I do not know. It is impossible
to tell. If I were in your place, I would
hold on as long as I could, on the chance.
Meanwhile, take things as easily as you can,
and don’t worry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is sometimes harder to take things
easily than to—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques was interrupted by a knock at
the door, followed by a call from Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May I come in, daddy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hastily the young Frenchman turned to
the doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you won’t speak to her about it yet?”
he urged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I promise you to wait until you give
me permission.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you,” St. Jacques answered. “It
is better to keep silent for the present. Still,
it is a relief to have told you, and to know
your opinion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, daddy, I’m coming. I want to talk
to you,” Nancy reiterated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Noiselessly the doctor slid back the bolt on
the panelled door, just as Nancy turned the
knob. It was done so deftly that the girl
pushed open the door and entered the room,
without in the least suspecting that she had
walked in upon a secret conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You here?” she said, nodding gayly to
St. Jacques.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes; but I am just going away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t hurry. I only came to ask my
father a question or two. How much longer
are we going to stay here, daddy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor pressed together, tip to tip, the
fingers of his two hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry, Nancy,” he answered a little
deprecatingly; “but I am afraid it will take
me fully three weeks longer to finish my
work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her face fell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is that all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I thought you were in a hurry to get
home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was; but I’m not,” she answered, in
terse contradiction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques laughed, as he bowed in exaggerated
gratitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Canada thanks you for the compliment,
Miss Howard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s not so much Canada as Quebec, not so
much Quebec as it is The Maple Leaf,” she
replied. “It is going to be a great wrench,
when I tear myself out of this place. But it
will be three weeks at least, daddy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fully that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy twisted the letter in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’ve heard again from Joe, and he wants
to come, the last of the week,” she said slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques caught the note of discontent in
her voice and smiled. It escaped the doctor,
however, and he made haste to answer,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But we are always glad to see Joe. How
long will he stay?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Two or three days. He has never been
here, and he expects me to show him the sights
of Quebec. Imagine me, M. St. Jacques,
doing the tourist patter, as I take him the
grand round!” Then she turned back to her
father. “Joe obviously has something on his
mind, daddy. You don’t suppose it is a case
of Persis Routh.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jealous, Nancy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course I am. Joe is my especial
property, you know. Besides, I don’t like
Persis.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor laughed again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither do I. Still, she is wonderfully
pretty.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” Nancy added disconsolately; “and
she doesn’t have red hair and a consequent
pain in her temper. Daddy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.” With his back to the two young
people, the doctor was cramming some papers
into his limp portfolio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Were you going to walk with me, this
afternoon?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, my dear; I wasn’t.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But you promised.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At dinner, yesterday. You promised that,
if I would let you off then, you would go with
me, to-day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did I? I am sorry. Really, Nancy, I
can’t go.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But it is a perfect day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t doubt it; but I have an appointment
with the ghost of Monseigneur Laval.
Both his time and mine are precious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I want to go,” Nancy said, with a
suspicion of a pout.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out to Sillery.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor looked at her in benign rebuke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nancy, it is eight miles to Sillery and back,
and your father is short of wind. Even if
Monseigneur Laval’s ghost were not calling
me, I couldn’t be tempted to take any such
tramp as that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then, though apparently by chance,
St. Jacques stepped forward. The doctor’s
eyes lighted, as they fell upon this possible
substitute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better ask M. St. Jacques to go,
Nancy. I was just advising him to be out in
the open air as much as possible.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s spine stiffened slightly, but quite
perceptibly. Much as she liked St. Jacques
and enjoyed his society, it was no part of her
plan to accept his escort, when it was offered
by a third person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M. St. Jacques has lectures and things to
go to, daddy,” she said, with an accent of calm
rebuke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques started to speak; but the doctor
forestalled him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then he’d better cut the lectures. There
may be such a thing as working too hard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy felt a swift longing to administer personal
chastisement to her father. She wondered
if good men were, of their very goodness,
bound to be unduly guileless. She bit her
lip. Then she smiled sweetly at St. Jacques.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But M. St. Jacques may have other plans
for the afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time, the Frenchman took the matter
into his own hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As soon as it becomes my turn to speak—”
he interpolated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well?” Nancy inquired obdurately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I should like to say that I have nothing
to do, this afternoon; that I was wishing for a
walk, and that no other comrade would be half
so enjoyable as Miss Nancy Howard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,” Nancy responded. “Is that all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is enough. Will you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If my father hasn’t decoyed you into the
trap, quite against your will.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques raised his brows.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Did you ever know me to say things for
the mere sake of being polite?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” Nancy said honestly; “I never did.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then where is your hat?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy laughed. Then she departed to
wrestle with her hat pins, while the good
doctor rubbed his hands with pleasure over
the successful tact with which he had won his
uninterrupted afternoon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A round hour later, they stood on the
church steps, looking down upon Sillery Cove.
One starlit night, long years before, a young
general, indomitable in the presence of mortal
disease as in the face of an impregnable foe,
had dropped down the river to land at that
spot and, scaling the cliff, to fight his way to
his victorious death. Now the dropping tide
had left a broad beach, and the Cove lay in
heavy shadow; but, beyond, the open stream
flashed blue in the sunlight. Full to the northward,
the windows in the rifle factory caught
the light and tossed it back to them, dazzling
as the glory which Wolfe, landing in the Cove,
was fated to find awaiting him upon those selfsame
Plains. Still farther beyond, the rock
city lay, a gray mound against the vivid blue
of the distant hills, and above its crest, even
from afar, Nancy could distinguish the blood-red
dot which flutters each day from dawn to
dusk above the cannon on the King’s Bastion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you care to see the inside of the
church?” St. Jacques asked her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. I may never come here again,
and I am growing to love your churches,”
Nancy answered, suddenly calling herself back
from a dream of the day when the golden lilies
floated above the Citadel, and of the night when
the fleet of English boats crept noiselessly
up the river to face—and win—a forlorn
hope of victory. Then abruptly she faced St.
Jacques. “Bigot or no Bigot, right or wrong,
my sympathies are sometimes with the French,”
she said. “Wolfe was a hero; but I can’t help
siding with the under dog, even if he is coated
with gold and fat with bones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques smiled at her outburst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And the under dog is always grateful,”
he replied briefly. “Come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Cap in hand, he led the way into the empty
church, made his swift genuflection before the
altar, and turned to look at Nancy. The girl
stood a step or two in the rear, glancing about
her at the arching roof and at the decorations
of the chancel. St. Jacques hesitated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Mademoiselle will excuse me,” he said
then, for the first time in their acquaintance
speaking in his native tongue. And, without
waiting for Nancy to reply, he went swiftly forward,
bowed for a moment at the altar rail, then
turned and knelt before the first of the painted
Stations of the Cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was done with the simple unconsciousness
of a child to whom his religion was a
matter of every-day experience. Nevertheless,
as Nancy stepped noiselessly into a pew and
rested her cheek on her clasped fingers, she
knew by instinct that her companion was in
no normal mood. It was not for nothing that
Nancy had watched the sturdy little Frenchman
during the past month. Watching him
now, she could see the pallor underneath his
swarthiness, see the sudden weakening of his
resolute chin, and the pitiful curve of the thin
lips. Then, all at once, St. Jacques covered
his face with his slim, dark hands, and Nancy
could see nothing more. Involuntarily she
wondered whether she might not already have
seen too much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques was smiling, when he joined her
at the door; but they both were rather silent,
as they went down the interminable flight of
steps which leads to Champlain Street, and
came out on the broad beach of sand that borders
the Cove when the tide is low. Even
during their brief delay in the church, the
short afternoon had waned perceptibly, and
the sun had dropped beneath the crest of the
point. Behind their backs, the bluff rose in a
wall of deep purple rock, at their right it was
splashed with an occasional dot of color where
some sheltered maple still held its crown of
ruddy leaves. The river beside them flowed
on noiselessly, swiftly, relentlessly as time itself,
in a level sheet of steely gray. But, beyond
the gray, relentless flowing, there rose the
stately cliffs of Lévis, solid, permanent and
bathed in a glow of mingled purple and gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As they rounded the Cove with its rotting,
moss-grown piers, and reached the point
whence Champlain Street runs in a straight-cut
line at the base of the cliff, St. Jacques
came out of his silence, and began to talk once
more. At first, Nancy stared at him in amazement.
In all their acquaintance, she had seen
him in no such mood of rattling gayety. The
words flew from his tongue, now English, now
French, framing themselves into every conceivable
sort of quip and whim and jest. He
laughed at Nancy for her lusty Americanism,
predicted her conversion to Canadian life and
ways, made sport of his own experiences when
he had come, a stranger, to Laval and Quebec.
He laughed about Barth and eulogized him
by turns, paused to give a word of hearty
admiration to Brock, and then rushed on into
a merry account of his boyhood among the
little brothers and sisters in the quiet French
home at Rimouski. Then, as they mounted
the little rise beneath Cape Diamond, his merriment
fell from him like the falling of a mask.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard,” he said suddenly; “do
you remember the sword of Damocles?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” she assented, at a loss for the key to
this new mood. “What of it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He pointed up to the cliff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That. They were all at supper, resting
and happy after the day, playing with their
little children, perhaps, when the rock fell
upon them. There was no warning, and there
were tons and tons of the rock. Seventy-eight
were found, and their coffins were placed
together in one huge pile before the altar rails.
Nobody knows how many more are buried
under this little hill in the road. It was impossible
to move away the stone; they could
only level it as best they could, and build
above it a road for the living to walk on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy shivered. All at once she became
aware of the chill that swept in from the river,
of the growing dusk which the scattered electric
lights were powerless to break. Above
her, the cliff towered in sinister, threatening
dignity; and the houses below leaned to its
face impotently, as if their weakness appealed
to its strength for mercy and support.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques drew a deep breath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is no easy thing to live on steadily
under an overhanging fate,” he said, half to
himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nancy heard and wondered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, from the heart of the dusk far up the
river, there came a distant throbbing. It grew
nearer, more distinct, until they could make
out the dim outline of a mighty ocean-going
steamer. In steady majesty it swept down
upon them, glowing with lights from stem to
stern, passed them by and, only a few hundred
feet beyond them, paused to drift idly on the
current, as it sent out its shrill call for a
pilot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sudden whistle roused St. Jacques from
his absorption. He shook himself free from
his mood, and faced Nancy again with a
laughing face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” he said. “Supper is calling, and
we must hurry.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Merrily they picked their way along the
darkening tunnel of Little Champlain Street,
merrily they slid upward in the dismal wooden
recesses of the elevator, merrily they tramped
along Sainte Anne Street and halted at the door
of The Maple Leaf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the threshold, Nancy faced St. Jacques
with merry eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you so much for my glorious walk,”
she said eagerly. “Confess that it has been a
most jovial occasion.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But all the merriment had fled from the
dark eyes of St. Jacques.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps,” he assented gravely. “But a
true Frenchman often smiles most gayly when
he has been hardest hit.” And, cap in hand,
he stood aside to let Nancy pass in before him.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER NINETEEN</h2>

<p class='pindent'>International complications had
arisen at the supper table. Confronted by
an English menu, the four elderly Frenchmen
had held a hasty consultation over a
new item which had appeared thereon. Their
minds were strictly logical; they had come
to the conclusion that sweetbreads were a
species of cake, and they had ordered accordingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Mais oui</span>,” one of them observed, as he
gravely prodded the resultant tidbit with his
knife and fork. “Vat ees eet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Them’s the sweetbreads,” responded the
waitress, who was an Hibernian and scanty of
grammar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There followed an anxious pause, while four
prodding forks worked in unison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Huitres?</span>” suggested one Frenchman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>Côtelettes?</span>” added the second.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est bon</span>,” said the third, more daring than
his companions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the fourth pushed aside his plate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>C’est dommage!</span>” he exclaimed, and Nancy,
who shared his opinion, took refuge in her
napkin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She emerged to find Brock just taking his
place beside her, and she looked up with a welcoming
smile. After the too obvious devotion
of the Englishman, after the self-repressed,
high-strung temperament of St. Jacques, Nancy
was always conscious of a certain sense of relief
in the society of the jovial Canadian. It is no
slight gift to be always merry, always thoughtful
of the comfort of one’s companions, always
at peace with one’s self and with the world.
This gift Brock possessed in its entirety.
Without him at her elbow, Nancy would have
passed many a lonely hour in Quebec. An
own brother could not have been more undemonstratively
careful to heed her slightest
wish. Best of all, Brock had a trick of placing
himself at her service, not at all as if he were
in love with her; but merely as if it were the
one thing possible for him to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just once, their friendship had lacked little
of coming to grief. On the evening after the
market episode, Nancy had gathered together
her courage and had read Brock a long lecture
upon his sins. An hour later, she had retired
from the contest, worsted. With imperturbable
good nature, Brock had assented to her charges
against him. Then, swiftly turning the tables,
he had summed up all of Barth’s vulnerable
points and had accused her of increasing their
number by an injudicious system of coddling.
Nancy’s hair was red, her temper by no means
imperturbable. She had defended herself with
vigor and clearness. Then, with snapping
eyes, she had stalked away out of the room,
leaving Brock, serene and smiling, in undisturbed
possession of the field. The next
morning, Brock had been called out of town
on business. When he returned, two days
later, Nancy had met him with whole-hearted
smiles. Without Brock’s genial presence, the
atmosphere of The Maple Leaf became altogether
too fully charged with electricity for her
liking. From that time onward, Nancy remembered
her hair, and fought shy of argument
with the tall Canadian whose very
imperturbability only rendered him the more
maddening foe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You look as if you had heard some good
news,” she assured him, even while he was
unfolding his napkin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock smiled with conscious satisfaction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long must I wait?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How unkind of you, when you know I
am consumed with curiosity!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the butterknife in his hand, Brock
turned. Nancy, as she looked far into the
depths of those clear gray eyes of his, was
suddenly aware that all was right with Brock’s
world. Moreover, she was aware that he was
as eager as she herself for the week to pass
away and give him the chance to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I really must wait,” she assented to
the look in his eyes. “A week is a long time.
Meanwhile, I have some news.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good, I hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly. We are expecting a guest,
next Friday.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How unlucky for him!” Brock observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are you superstitious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; but you are.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She raised her brows in question, and Brock
answered the unspoken words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Otherwise, why do you carry a pocket
edition of Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know I do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because it fell out on the floor just now,
when I upset your coat. It is a very superior
little Sainte Anne, made of silver.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This time, Nancy had the grace to blush.
Only the day before, she had come into possession
of the dainty toy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s not superstition,” she answered;
“it is merely an effigy of my patron saint.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock nodded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For the name? I suspect I could tell who
chose it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Nancy’s brows rose inquiringly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If you like,” she said composedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Barth, of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. I knew you would say so. Now
you have forfeited your one guess,” she responded
smilingly, yet with an odd little tugging
at her heart, as she recalled the face of
St. Jacques, as he had laid the little silver
image into her outstretched palm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Make her your patron saint as well,” he
had said briefly. “The time may come when
I shall need the prayers of her name-child to
help me at her shrine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Nancy, looking straight into his
dark eyes, had given the promise that he
asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now, with full intention, she was seeking
to drive St. Jacques from her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t ask about our guest,” she added.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” Brock buttered his bread with calm
deliberation. “I knew you would tell me,
when you were ready.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She fell into the trap laid by his apparent
indifference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am ready now. It is an old friend of
ours from New York, Mr. Joseph Churchill.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So glad he is an old friend,” Brock responded
coolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because he won’t complicate things, as a
young man would do.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Churchill is twenty-five,” Nancy
remarked a little severely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We call that rather young up here. Will
he stop long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A day or two.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock helped himself to marmalade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he comes, next Friday?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Right, oh! See that he gets out of the
way by Monday. The Maple Leaf is quite
full enough, as it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But he is going to the Chateau,” Nancy
explained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lucky fellow to have money enough! In
his place, I should probably have to seek the
Lower Town. What are you going to do with
him?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy smiled ingratiatingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just what I was meaning to ask you, Mr.
Brock.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock’s answering laugh sent Barth’s fingers
in search of the string of his eyeglasses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s a snug little cell empty up at the
Citadel,” he suggested. “Take him up there
and let him see how he likes military hospitality.
He could put in a very instructive two days,
studying the position of the Bunker Hill
cannon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days later, Nancy stood in the extreme
bow of the Lévis ferry. Beside her, blond and
big and altogether bonny, stood Mr. Joseph
Churchill, obviously an American, equally
obviously from New York. At the stern, in
the lee of the deck house, Dr. Howard was
doing his best to shelter himself from the
cutting wind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy and the New Yorker were in full tide
of conversation. No hint of regret had marked
Nancy’s manner, as she had stood scanning the
doors of the sleeping-cars. Before Lévis was
a river-breadth behind, she had gathered from
her companion a detailed account of the early
gayeties of the season, had filled his ears with
the more sober charms of quaint Quebec, and
had drawn a vivid outline of the more salient
characteristics of Mr. Reginald Brock. Of
Barth and St. Jacques, she had omitted to make
any mention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Upon one point, the doctor was rigid.
Churchill might register at the Chateau, if he
insisted. He must take his meals with them
at The Maple Leaf. And so it came about
that Barth’s first intimation that a guest was
expected, occurred when he looked up from
his tea, that night, to greet Nancy as she came
into the room, and discovered the huge, sleek
American at Nancy’s side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, by George!” remarked Mr. Cecil
Barth, and promptly dropped his bread, butter-side
down, into the starched recesses of his
immaculate white waistcoat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later, he sought the parlor. Over his
shoulder, he had heard the gay voices of
Brock and Nancy, and the deeper chest tones
of the burly American. He felt an acute
longing to put on his glasses and, screwing
himself about in his chair, to take a prolonged
stare at the intruder. His hurried glance had
given him the impression of vast stature combined
with the workmanship of an unexceptionable
tailor. But where did the fellow
come from? What was the fellow doing there?
And what, oh, by George, what was the fellow’s
connection with Nancy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I’d like to punch him,” Mr. Cecil
Barth muttered vengefully to himself. “Oh,
rather!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found the parlor quite deserted. St.
Jacques, who had met Churchill earlier in the
afternoon, had betaken himself to his room.
Brock and the Howards, with their guest, were
still at the table. Accordingly, Barth pulled a
book from his pocket and sat himself down to
wait. He waited long. When at last Nancy
led the way into the parlor, Barth was surprised
to miss Brock from her train. Under such
conditions, it was inconceivable to him that the
Canadian should not have stood his ground.
The parlor was common property. He himself
would sit there forever, rather than let
himself be ousted by any American, least of all
an American who would bedeck himself with
jewelry as uncouth as the hymnbook of blue
and gold that dangled from this American’s
fob. Barth had always heard that Americans
were stiffed-necked dissenters. Nevertheless,
he had never supposed they would find it
needful to advertise their dissent by means of
enamelled trinkets. He wrapped himself in
his Britishism, and sat tight in his chair, waiting
to see what would occur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing occurred. Nancy gave him her
usual friendly smile and nod. Then, crossing
the room, she settled herself on a sofa and,
making room for Churchill at her side, dropped
into animated talk of places and persons who
were totally remote from Barth’s previous
knowledge. Now and then, she glanced across
at him carelessly. Now and then, her huge
companion turned and bestowed upon him a
rebuking stare which said, plainly as words
could have done, that his further presence there
was needless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Regardless of the fact that he knew Nancy
was fully aware he never read through his
glasses, Barth remained stolidly on guard,
glasses on nose and nose apparently in his
book. Now and then, however, he lowered
his book and refreshed himself with a smile at
Nancy, or a scowl at the unconscious back of
Nancy’s companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, Nancy could endure the situation
no longer. Much as she liked Barth, she
could willingly have dispensed with his society,
just then. After their weeks of separation, she
and Churchill had much to talk over, and
she found the presence of an outsider a check
upon the freedom of their dialogue. So sure
had she been of Barth’s prompt and tactful
withdrawal that she had made no effort to introduce
him, when they had first entered the
room. Her plans for the next day were formed
to include the young Englishman. For that
one evening, she had intended to give her
attention entirely to her guest. Now, however,
she saw that an introduction was fast becoming
a matter of social necessity, and she tried to
prepare the way for it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the space of a minute, she permitted
the talk with Churchill to lapse. Then, meeting
Barth’s eyes above the deckled edges of his
book, she smiled across at him in the friendly,
informal fashion he had learned to know and
to like so well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I thought you were bound for the theatre,
this evening, Mr. Barth,” she said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a wholly random bullet; but it met
its billet. Barth reddened. In his interest in
Nancy’s companion, he had entirely forgotten
his explicit announcement of his evening’s plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no,” he answered nonchalantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then men do occasionally change their
minds. Isn’t it a good play?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” he answered again, still more
nonchalantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Turning slightly, Churchill looked across at
the slender, boyish figure at the farther side of
the room. His glance was disrespectful, and
Barth was keenly conscious of the disrespect.
He made a manful effort to assert himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Jolly sort of night, Miss Howard,” was the
only bubble that effervesced from his mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy felt a wave of petulant sympathy
sweeping over her. Long experience of her
guest had taught her the meaning of that swift
motion of his head and shoulders, and she
feared what might follow, both for Barth’s sake
and her own. She dreaded any possible injury
to the feelings of the young Englishman; she
dreaded still more the hearing Churchill’s irreverent
comments upon a man whom she had
grown proud to number among her loyal
friends. Never had Barth appeared more impenetrably
dull, never more obdurately British!
It was the mockery of fate. Just when she was
praying that he might be at his best, he turned
monosyllabic, and then completed his disgrace
by talking about the weather. Meanwhile her
annoyance was forcing all ideas from her own
brain, and her answering question was equally
banal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it cold, to-night?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth was not impenetrable, by any means.
He felt Nancy’s embarrassment, was keenly
alive to her efforts in his behalf. The knowledge
only rendered him more tongue-tied than
ever; but his blue eyes smiled eagerly back at
her, as he responded, with admirable brevity,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, rather!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Joe, what is it?” Nancy demanded, as she
followed her strangling guest out into the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Churchill was walking to and fro, coughing
and teary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nancy Howard,” he said, as soon as he
could speak; “will you kindly tell me what
manner of thing that is?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Nancy asserted herself. Erect and
gracious in her dainty evening gown, she
turned back and stood on the threshold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Barth,” she said, in a quiet tone of
command; “will you please come here and be
introduced to my cousin? Mr. Churchill, I
want you to meet my friend,” an almost imperceptible
pause added emphasis to the word;
“my friend, Mr. Cecil Barth.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY</h2>

<p class='pindent'>“And this,” the guide continued, with the
loquacity of his kind; “directly at our
feet is the River Saint Lawrence. That building
there with the pointed roofs is the Chateau
Frontenac, built on the exact site of the old
Chateau de Saint Louis. Beyond it, you see
the spire of the French Basilica, consecrated
in sixteen hundred and sixty-six, and, slightly
to the right, are the roofs and spires of Laval.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And, right under our noses, the city of
Quebec, huddled indiscriminately around The
Maple Leaf,” Brock interrupted, as their red-coated
escort stopped for breath. “Miss
Howard, I wish you hadn’t been quite so
generous in your fee.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I am sure it is very interesting,”
Churchill observed politely. “Remember that
I am a stranger here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guide took the hint and edged towards
Churchill’s end of the line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is what is termed the King’s Bastion,”
he went on glibly. “Beyond is Cape Diamond,
so called from the crystals of quartz
that used to be found there. Now they are
very rare; but,” with every appearance of
anxiety, he fell to searching his pockets; “but
I happen to have—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Brock interrupted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No use, Thomas Atkins,” he said jovially.
“We are too old birds to be caught in that trap.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unabashed, the guide let the bits of quartz
drop back into his pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Many ladies admire my buttons,” he said
tentatively. “They make interesting hat pins.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The ladies, or the buttons?” Nancy
queried innocently. “But, thank you, I think
you have showed us everything, and we can
find our way out alone.” And, leaving the
bastion, she led the way back to the tiny cannon
of Bunker Hill, where she loyally halted
her companions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cloudless sky arched above the old gray
Citadel, that morning. Inside the walls, the
daily routine was going its usual leisurely
course. Few visitors were abroad; but an
occasional private strayed across the enclosure
and, not far from the gate, guard-mounting
was just taking place. Nancy watched the
new guard as it tramped out into the open,
saluted and went into position, its every evolution
followed in detail by the stout Newfoundland
dog who waddled along at its heels.
Then, as the band swung about and marched
off for its daily practice, she moved away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come,” she said a little impatiently.
“After the glorious past, the present is a bit
of anticlimax. Shall we go for a walk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her companions assented, and together they
went down into Saint Louis Street and turned
towards the terrace. As they passed Barth’s
quarters, he unexpectedly appeared upon the
steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Whither?” Nancy called blithely, as he
lifted his cap.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To post some letters.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come with us, instead,” she bade him,
notwithstanding the murmured protestations
which arose from both Brock and Churchill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To Nancy’s mind, the previous evening had
not been altogether a shining success. For
half an hour after their introduction, she had
dragged the two men through a species of conversation;
but there had been a triple sigh of
relief as the evening gun had marked the hour
for Barth’s departure. Nancy had followed
him to the parlor door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good night,” she said cordially there.
“We shall see you, in the morning?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh,—yes. If I can,” Barth answered
vaguely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he had made a dejected exit. As he
strolled languidly away to his room, he alternated
between fears of a possible relapse in his
ankle, and mutinous thoughts regarding the
hero of Valley Forge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Beastly race, those American men!” was
the finale of his reflections. “Oh, rather!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, however, his dejection vanished in the
face of the sunshiny morning and of Nancy’s
greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Won’t I be in the way?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why should you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t walk much, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I thought Englishmen were famous
for their walking,” Churchill said, as he greeted
the young Englishman much as a genial mastiff
might salute a youthful pug.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth glanced towards Nancy with a confident
smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Didn’t Miss Howard tell you?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About the way we first met. I sprained
my ankle, and Miss Howard turned into a
hired nurse, and took care of me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Churchill’s eyes sought Nancy’s scarlet
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The deuce she did! Where was this party?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This party?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, no. It wasn’t a party at all. I was
entirely by myself. I have sometimes wondered
how she ever chanced to find me in all
that crowd.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Probably the Good Sainte Anne guided her
unworthy namesake,” Nancy responded lightly.
“That was where the tragedy occurred.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh!” Beside Barth’s <span class='it'>oh</span>, that of Churchill
seemed needlessly crisp and curt. “But
I thought you were bored to death at Sainte
Anne-de-Beaupré, Nancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was only at first. Later, events
happened.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I should judge. Strange you forgot to
mention them!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There are unexplained gaps in your own
letters,” she reminded him audaciously. “It
was only by chance that I heard whom you
took out, the night of the Leighton dinner.”
Then she turned to the others. “We mustn’t
go far, this morning,” she added; “not so
much on account of your foot, Mr. Barth, as
because of our early dinner. Shall we take
ourselves to the terrace?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>High up on the glacis in the lee of the
King’s Bastion, they found a belated bit of
Indian summer. Nancy dropped down on the
crisp, dry turf and, turning, beckoned St.
Jacques to her side. Crossing the terrace with
Barth, she had seen the Frenchman pacing to
and fro beside the rail, and she had answered
his wishful greeting with a smile of welcome.
Leaving Brock and Churchill to lead the way,
Nancy had sauntered idly along in the rear,
adjusting her quick step to the frailties of
Barth’s ankle, her alert happiness to the
darker mood which sat heavily upon her other
companion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are not going to fail us, this afternoon,
M. St. Jacques?” she asked now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Silently he shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your cousin has a perfect day,” he said,
after a pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And he appreciates it. Already, he declares
himself the slave of the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are coming with me, in the morning?”
St. Jacques inquired.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not sure. I hope we can; but Mr.
Churchill is not a very good Catholic,” she
answered, with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques’s eyes lighted mirthfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But Sainte Anne is his patron saint?” he
questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy shook her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Alas, no! He has shifted his allegiance,
and poor Sainte Anne is feeling very much cut
up about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No matter,” St. Jacques answered philosophically.
“She is getting her fair share of
devotees, and, with France and England at
her shrine, she can afford to be content without
America.” Then his face darkened. “If
only she will be propitious!” he added, with
sudden gravity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s hand shut on a tuft of grass at her
side. Slowly she had come, during those past
days, to the realization of the dual personality
of the patron saint of Adolphe St. Jacques.
Half human, half divine, the Good Sainte
Anne was holding complete sway in the mind
of the young Frenchman, just then. Half his
unspoken wish was plain to her, half was still
beyond her ken. She wondered restlessly
when would come the time that she was free to
speak. She wondered, too, what were the
words she was destined to say.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a swift motion, St. Jacques settled
backward to rest his elbow on the grass at
her side. Pushing back his cap, as if its
slight weight irritated him, he swept the
dark hair from his forehead. Nancy frowned
involuntarily as her eyes rested on the angry
scar.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was a shocking blow,” she said pityingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He nodded, with slow thoughtfulness.
Then he bit his lip, and shook his hair forward
until the scar was completely hidden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It might have been worse—perhaps.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You’d better ask the Good Sainte Anne
to do a miracle on you,” Brock suggested, from
his place farther up the slope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly the dark eyes sought Nancy’s face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have already asked her,” Adolphe St.
Jacques answered quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And what did the lady say?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Frenchman’s eyes moved northward
and rested upon the purple tops of the far-off
Laurentides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My novena is not finished. She has yet
to make her answer,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, for the second time in their acquaintance,
Nancy was conscious of the dull tugging
at her heart. Forgetful of Barth, watching
from the other side, she turned to look straight
down into the face of St. Jacques; and Brock,
who alone of them all had been taken into the
heart of the Frenchman’s secret, felt it no
shame to himself when the tears rushed into
his clear gray eyes, as he saw the look on
Nancy’s face, womanly, earnest, yet all unconscious
of impending ill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Churchill who broke the silence. A
stranger to them all but Nancy, he yet could
not fail to realize the tension of the moment.
Nevertheless he assured himself that he had
met those symptoms before. Nancy’s path,
the past season, had been strewn with similar
victims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wonderful view!” he said calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The platitude broke the strain. St. Jacques
sat up and put on his cap, and Barth fumbled
for his glasses. Above them, Brock openly
rubbed his eyes with the bunched-up fingers
of his gloves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So glad you like it, Joe! It is wonderful;
and then it is endeared to me by all manner
of associations. Away up there in those blue
hills, Mr. Barth sprained his ankle; M. St.
Jacques and I spent an afternoon in this road
just underneath the cliff, and,” her eyes sought
Brock’s eyes mockingly; “and there aren’t
ten blocks in the entire city that can’t mark
some sort of a skirmish between the American
and Canadian forces.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock’s answering shot was prompt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is only that America refuses to be annexed,”
he supplemented gravely. “We hope
to bring her to terms in time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Barth fell to kicking the turf in moody
discontent. Nancy checked him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t destroy the glacis of your chief
American outpost, Mr. Barth. You may need
it sometime to fight off the French from your
possessions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her words had been wholly free from any
allegorical meaning. Nevertheless, Barth’s
heels ground into the turf more viciously than
ever, as he made grim answer,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, we English need no artificial defenses
to fight off the Frenchmen, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sic ’em!” Brock observed impartially.
Then he snatched his hat from his head, and,
forgetful of their differences, Barth and St.
Jacques followed his lead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Distant and faint from behind the sheltering
wall came the strains of <span class='it'>God Save the King</span>, as
the band marched back from practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Strange to hear <span class='it'>America</span> up here!”
Churchill said idly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>America?</span>” The Frenchman’s accent was
inquiring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. That is our national anthem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long since?” Brock queried coolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, always, I suppose.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth bestowed a contemplative stare upon
the stranger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How very—American!” he observed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course. We think it is rather characteristic,
and are no end proud of it,” Churchill
assured him blandly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth sat up, straight and stiff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Churchill, did you ever happen to
hear of <span class='it'>God Save the King</span>?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Queen? Oh, beg pardon! She’s dead,
and it is a king now. Yes, I’ve heard of it.
What about it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That.” Barth swept his little gray cap
towards the dying notes of the final phrase.
“Your so-called <span class='it'>America</span> is only our <span class='it'>God Save
the King</span>.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is it? I’m no musician, and didn’t know.
Still, I can’t see that it hurts it, to have started
with you. So did we all, if it comes to that.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then you should give us the credit for
having originated it,” Brock suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques rolled over on his other elbow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“As it happens, Brock, you didn’t originate
it. It came from the other side of the
Channel.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, rather! But it’s ours,” Barth interposed
hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques rolled back again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I beg your pardon, Mr. Barth; but it
chances to be French,” he returned quietly.
“Lulli wrote it for Louis Quatorze, and England
borrowed it without returning thanks.”
And then, still leaning on his elbow with his
eyes fixed upon Barth, he sang to the end the
good old song,—</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<div class='literal-container' style=''><div class='literal'> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class='line'>“Grand Dieu! Sauvez le Roi!</p>
<p class='line'>Grand Dieu! Sauvez le Roi!</p>
<p class='line'>Sauvez le Roi!</p>
<p class='line'>Que toujours glorieux,</p>
<p class='line'>Louis Victorieux,</p>
<p class='line'>Voye ses ennemis</p>
<p class='line'>Toujours soumis.”</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the light baritone voice died on the still
air, Nancy looked down at him with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“France scores, this time,” she said. “But
what a text for an international alliance! Here
we are, three nations sitting under the eaves of
the most famous citadel in America, and each
claiming as his very own the same national
anthem.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh; but it is generally admitted to belong
to us,” Barth added, with unflinching persistence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next night, Churchill and the doctor
were left alone for a few moments. The
doctor held out his hand with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nancy tells me you are open to congratulation,
Joe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. That is what brought me up here.
I am too fond of you both to be willing to
take your congratulations in ink. She is a
wonderful girl, Uncle Ross.” The happiness
of the young American sat well upon him.
In his uncle’s eyes, he gained dignity, even as
he spoke those few words. Then he laughed.
“You may find yourself in the face of a similar
situation,” he suggested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The doctor stared at him for a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not a bit! Not a bit!” he said
then. “Every lover is looking for love.
Nancy is nothing but a little girl.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Churchill smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then look out for your little girl. You
may lose her, some day.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” the doctor protested valiantly.
“The Lady will see to that. They are nice
boys, good boys; but they are only children.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be too sure. If I know anything
at all about such matters—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t,” the doctor interrupted testily.
“But go on! Go on!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then St. Jacques is very much in love
with Nancy; and, what is more, that snip of
an Englishman is in love with her, too.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Hh! And what about Brock?” growled
the doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Churchill thrust his hands into his pockets
and smiled back into the frowning face of his
uncle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That’s where you have me,” he answered
coolly. “I have been watching the two of
them, all day long, and I’ll be sanctified if I
can tell you now.”</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Four days after Churchill took his departure
from Quebec and its Maple
Leaf, Brock came striding into the dining-room,
his head erect, his gray eyes shining.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard, you are going for a walk,
this afternoon,” he said, as he drew back his
chair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How do you know?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Because I am counting on you. Have
you anything else to do?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I was going to the library,” she suggested.
“The new magazines are just in.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Let them wait,” he said coolly. “It is
too fine a day to be wasted over a fire and a
book. I’ll not only show you a new picture;
but I promise to tell you a better story than
any that ever was written into a magazine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy looked up into his happy eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then the week is over?” she questioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At last.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She laughed at his accent of relief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How impatient you were! Your secret
must have preyed upon you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not so bad as that,” he began; but she
interrupted him mockingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And how many people have you been
telling, in the meantime?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not one.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Truthfully?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. I wanted to tell you, first of all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She smiled back at him fearlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. I appreciate it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And will you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course,” she answered heartily. “Did
a woman ever refuse to listen to a secret?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>An hour later, she joined him in the hall.
Brock stared at her approvingly. Her dark
green cloth gown was the work of a tailor of
sorts; the plumes of her wide hat made an
admirable setting for her halo of ruddy hair.
And Nancy returned the approval in full
measure. Few men were better to look upon
than was Reginald Brock, tall and supple, his
well-set head thatched with crisp brown hair
and lighted with those merry, clear gray eyes.
No sinister thought had ever left its line on
Brock’s honest, manly face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, then,” he said, as he opened the
door. “You are in my hands, this afternoon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He led the way to the Lower Town. Then,
leaving Notre Dame des Victoires far behind
them, they passed the custom house, crossed
to the Louise Embankment and, rounding the
angle by the immigration sheds, came out on
the end of the Commissioners’ Wharf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There!” Brock said triumphantly. “What
do you think of this?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy drew a long breath of sheer delight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“One can’t think; one can only feel,” she
said slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The river, lying deep blue in the yellow
sunlight, slid past their very feet, its glittering
wavelets crossed and recrossed with silvery
reflections caught from the sky above. Far
down its course, the dark indigo Laurentides
seemed jutting out into the stream that washed
their feet. Above was the Citadel, a crown of
gray upon its purplish cliff. Behind them,
the noise of the city lost itself in the murmur
of the hurrying tide. Close at hand, a network
of cables was lowering freight into the
hold of an ocean-going steamer; and, out
in the middle of the stream, a clumsy craft,
loaded to the water’s edge, crawled sluggishly
upward against current and tide, ready for the
morrow’s market.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock pointed to an unused anchor, close
to the edge of the embankment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we sit down?” he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy took her place in silence. Silently
he dropped down beside her. It was a long
time before the stillness was broken, save by
the lapping of the river at their feet and the
hoarse cries of the men in the steamer’s hold.
For the moment, they were as isolated as if
they had been in some remote desert, rather
than upon the edge of one of the busiest spots
of the entire city.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock’s impatience appeared to have left
him. With his gaze on the river, he was
whistling almost inaudibly to himself; but it
was plain to Nancy, as she watched him, that
his thoughts were altogether pleasant ones. So
were her own, for the matter of that. The past
month had been a happy one to her, and
Brock had caused some of its happiest memories.
She had trusted him completely, and she
had never known him to fail her. His chivalry,
his courtesy, his brother-like care had
been for her, from the hour of their meeting.
She could still recall the glad look in his eyes, as
they had rested upon her when he entered the
dining-room, that first night. From that hour
onward, Nancy Howard and Reginald Brock
had been sure, each of the other’s friendship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What about it?” Brock asked, as he
suddenly turned to face her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About what?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The subject of your thoughts.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All good things,” she answered unhesitatingly.
“I was thinking about you, just
then.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And wishing me good?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“All good, even as you have been good to
me,” she responded, with quiet dignity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nothing to count. But now for the
picture.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is beautiful beyond words.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>He smiled again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Wait. You haven’t seen it yet.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a quick motion of his hand, he drew
his watch from his pocket, opened the case and
held it out to Nancy. There was no cloud of
reservation in the girl’s happy eyes, as she
looked at the picture within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mr. Brock!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>His accent was full of happy question.
Downright and prompt came Nancy’s answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She is adorable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gently he took the watch from her hand
and looked steadily at the picture, a picture of
a round girlish face set as proudly as Brock’s
own upon its shapely shoulders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes,” he assented slowly. “Better than
that, she is good.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no mistaking the gladness in
Nancy’s tone, as she responded,—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think I was never more delighted in all my
life. You were good to tell me, first of all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wanted to,” Brock replied, with boyish
eagerness. “We’ve been such good chums,
all this last month, that I was sure you would
be interested. I want you to meet her. We
weren’t going to announce it just yet; but I
coaxed her to hurry it up a little, so I could
bring her to call on you, before you go home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy still held the picture in her hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Is she really as pretty as this?” she asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why,—yes, I suppose so. I used to
think so. Lately, I haven’t thought much
about her looks, one way or the other,” he
confessed. “She always seems to me about
right, and she knows things, too. Really,
Miss Howard,” as he spoke, he faced Nancy,
with his eyes shining; “really, I’m in great
luck. It isn’t every day that a girl of her sort
falls in love with a fellow like me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no hint of coquetry in Nancy’s
manner. With a frankness his own sister
might have shown, she held out her hand in
token of congratulation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am not so sure of that,” she answered,
with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then the pause lengthened. Brock’s thoughts
were far afield; Nancy’s were fixed upon the
man at her side. In all sincerity, she did rejoice
at his unexpected tidings. No sentimental
regrets entered into her perfect content. Her
friendship for Brock had been friendship pure
and simple; on neither side had it ever been
mingled with a thought of love. From chance
playmates of an October holiday, they had
grown into a loyal liking which was to outlast
many a dividing year and mile. And Brock
deserved all good things, even the love of this
dainty bit of girlhood whose eyes smiled bravely
back into her own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tell me all about it,” she said at last.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock roused himself from his reverie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There’s not so much to tell. I’ve known
her always; we’ve always been good friends,
but, last summer at Cacouna, it was—different.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy smiled at the pause which added explanatory
force to the last word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And was it then?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; not till two or three weeks ago. You
see, it took me a good while to get to where
I dared speak about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when—?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Brock looked up suddenly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I don’t dare think of that yet, Miss
Howard,” he answered a bit unsteadily. “The
present is so perfect that I am afraid to tempt
Fate by asking anything more of the future.
For the present, I am like the river out there,”
he pointed to the shining stream before him;
“just drifting along in the sunshine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the sunshine found an answering light
in Nancy’s eyes, as, accepting his offered hand,
she slowly rose to her feet and turned her face
towards home.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h2>

<p class='pindent'>The clouds hung gray and low over the
old gray city. From the river the wind
swept in, raw and cutting, and the Laurentides
lay in the purple haze which betokens a coming
storm. The terrace was deserted; the fountain
in the Ring had stopped playing, and narrow
Sainte Anne Street was turned into a tunnel
thick with flying dust. Indian summer was at
an end, and winter was at hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With her ruddy hair flying and her broad
hat tilted rakishly over one ear, Nancy came
fighting her way down Saint Louis Street and
across the Place d’Armes. Her pulses were
pounding gayly with the intoxication of the
cold; her face glowed with the struggle of
meeting the boisterous wind. From his ducal
casement, Barth eyed her wishfully. Then he
returned to his book. Nancy, in such a mood
as that, defied his powers of comprehension.
Upon one former occasion he had seen her
thus, a veritable spirit of the storm. Experience
had taught him certain lessons. Mr.
Cecil Barth looked down on Nancy’s erect
head and blazing cheeks, on her vigorous,
elastic tread. Looking, he sighed, and prudently
remained hidden in his room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Ten minutes later, Nancy’s shut hand descended
upon her father’s door. The door was
locked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, daddy, are you there?” she called
ingratiatingly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no reply, and she tapped again.
This time, the doctor answered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Busy, Nancy.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really and truly?” she wheedled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, how mean of you! How long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I can’t tell.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her lips to the keyhole, she heaved an
ostentatious sigh. The sigh brought forth no
sign of relenting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am very lonesome, daddy,” she said
then. “It is too bad of you to neglect me
like this. But, if you really won’t let me in,
I’m going out on the ramparts for a breath
of fresh air.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” the doctor’s accent bespoke his
manifest relief. “Go on, dear; but don’t get
blown away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No; and don’t you fall asleep over your
horrid old manuscripts, and forget to let yourself
out and come down to supper,” she cautioned
him. “Good by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Going back to her room, she took off her
jacket and broad hat, and replaced them with a
sealskin coat and toque. Then she went running
down the stairs and turned out into
Sainte Anne Street, already powdered thickly
with falling flakes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the coming of the snow, the wind was
dying, and Nancy made her way easily enough
around the corner into Buade Street, past the
Chien d’Or, gnawing his perennial bone high
in the air, and out to the northeast corner of
the city wall where she halted, breathless, beside
one of the venerable guns.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just then, the door of the doctor’s room
opened, and Adolphe St. Jacques stepped out
into the hall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Courage, boy!” said the doctor kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And St. Jacques nodded in silence, as he
gripped the outstretched hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As a matter of course, he took his way
straight in the direction of the ramparts. St.
Jacques could think of but one person in the
world, just then; and that person was Nancy
Howard. He overtook her at the angle of the
ancient wall. Later, it occurred to him that
there was a symbolic meaning in the situation,
as he came hurrying onward, with Laval at his
left, Nancy at his right, and the brief, empty
stretch of road before him. At the time, however,
he had but one thought, and that was to
get to Nancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He found her standing with her back towards
the direction from whence he came. One arm
lay lightly across the cannon, the other rested
on the old gray parapet which made a fitting
background for her slight figure in its dark cloth
skirt and dark fur coat. Her shoulders were
sprinkled with the fine, soft snow and, against
the snowy air above the river, her vivid hair,
loosened by the wind, stood out in a gleaming
aureole above the high collar of her coat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned with a start to find St. Jacques
at her side. Releasing the cannon, she held
out her hand in blithe greeting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t this superb?” she exclaimed breathlessly.
“I am so glad you have come to enjoy
it with me. See how the river is all blown
into a chopping sea! And the snow over
Lévis! And look at those thick clouds of
snow that keep scurrying across the river!
How can people stay in-doors and lose it all?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For an instant, St. Jacques felt himself dazzled
by her beauty and by her strong vitality.
In all his past experience, there had been no
other Nancy. He sought to get a firm grasp
upon himself. The instant’s delay caught
Nancy’s quick attention, and she shrank from
him, as she saw his rigid face and lambent eyes.
Then she rallied and laughed lightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is it, M. St. Jacques?” she queried.
“You look as if you had seen a ghost.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So I have.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was it a pretty one?” she asked nervously,
as she locked her hands above the crowned
monogram on the gun, and stood looking at
him a little defiantly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was the ghost of what I might have
been,” he answered quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Nancy sought to dominate the scene.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So bad as that?” she asked, with a futile
attempt at flippancy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He disregarded her words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard,” he said slowly; “I have
come to say good by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Instantly her tone changed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I am so sorry! Is it for a long time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I may not come back while you are here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was plain that he was struggling hard to
hold himself steady; and Nancy, at a loss to
explain the situation, nevertheless found herself
sharing his mood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am sorry,” she repeated slowly. “Are
you going to leave Quebec?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am going home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There is no trouble there, I hope.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. The trouble is all here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy’s mind went swiftly southward to the
frisky, boyish days that unfold themselves at
Yale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At Laval?” she questioned, with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques shook his head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What should be the trouble at Laval?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, nothing; unless you have come into
collision with a dean or two,” she answered
hastily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>St. Jacques smiled, with a pitiful attempt at
mirth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No. On the other hand, something came
into collision with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What was that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For his only answer, he brushed aside his
hair and let the storm sweep pitilessly against
the scar beneath. Nancy caught her breath
sharply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“M. St. Jacques! Do you mean that it is
going to be serious?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So serious that I must give up all work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who says so?” she demanded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Your father.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father?” Nancy’s accent dropped to
utter hopelessness. “For how long?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Until I am better.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And when will that be?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He says it is impossible for him to tell.
Perhaps—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps?” Nancy echoed questioningly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps—never.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no answer for a moment. Then
Nancy’s glove tore itself across with the strain
of her clenched fingers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, I could kill the man who struck that
blow!” she burst out. Then her head went
down on the crowned monogram, and the
silence dropped again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length, Nancy raised her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Shall we walk on?” she asked, as steadily
as she could. “It is very cold here, all at
once.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Side by side, they turned the corner to the
westward, and came into comparative shelter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“How long have you known it?” she said,
as soon as she could speak quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just as you came to the door of your
father’s room.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She drew a slow breath, as she looked up at
his face, white, but resolute still.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And already it seems ages old. You are
sure?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is. It has been coming on for a
month now. Three weeks ago, I went to
your father and told him that I feared there
was trouble. He bade me wait, to live out of
doors and to work as little as possible. I kept
the hope. My profession means so much to
me now, that I could not give it up.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I know. Your profession is your
very life,” Nancy answered gently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Swiftly he turned and faced her. In that
one glance, Nancy saw all the fiery, repressed
nature of the man, read his secret and, with a
sinking heart, acknowledged to herself the fatal
keenness of the blow which she must one day
in honor deal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the answer of St. Jacques was already in
her ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It means far more than life.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She tried to stem the tide of his words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“When do you go?” she asked hurriedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So soon as that?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There must be an operation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“At my home. Your father will go with me.
Every one says no greater man can be found.
He is very good,” St. Jacques added simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Nancy’s courage failed her. Again
she looked into her companion’s face, and
took heart from the resolution written there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wish I knew what to say,” she said
quietly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sometimes there is nothing to say. It is all
said for us,” he replied, with sudden dreariness.
“Meanwhile, may I ask a favor of you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You have your little Sainte Anne?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For her only answer, she took it from the
folds of her blouse and laid it in his hand.
He walked on for a moment, looking down at
it with loving, reverent eyes. Then he gave
it back into her keeping.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I had hoped so much from it,” he said
slowly; “so much more than you ever knew.
I regarded the name as an omen of good. I
even made my novena; but it was all in vain.”
His voice dropped. “All in vain.” Then
he steadied himself. “But the favor? It is
to be next Thursday, three days from now.
The operation, I mean. On that day, will
you go out to the shrine of the Good Sainte
Anne, and say a prayer for me? You are no
Catholic, I know; but it will help me to be
brave, if I can feel that together you and she
are making intercession in my behalf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Resolutely Nancy brushed the tears from
her cheeks and faced him with a smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I—promise,” she said. Then her voice
failed her again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you. It will be a help. Beyond
that, I ask nothing of you. In the one case,
it could do no good. In the other, I shall
come back to you. There is no need to tell
you all I have wished—and hoped—and
prayed for, all you have been in my life, these
past weeks. If the Good Sainte Anne wills it,
I shall tell it all to you, some day. If not—good
by.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As he took her hand into his strong fingers,
Nancy’s tear-dim eyes were blind to everything
but the unspoken love and longing in
the great dark eyes before her, everything but
the point of the lower lip rolling outward in
its pitiful attempt to form its own brave, characteristic
little smile.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, hat in hand and the snow sifting
down on his thick dark hair, he turned away
and left her alone beside the old gray wall in
the fast-gathering snow.</p>

<p class='line'>&#160;</p>

<h2>CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Five days later, the doctor came back from
Rimouski. Nancy, on the platform of the
station, waited eagerly until he came in sight.
Then she stepped back and hid her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It was all so like his life,” her father said,
when they sat together in his room, that night;
“brave and quiet and full of thought for us all.
Once he rallied for a few hours, and we felt
there was hope. At the very last, he gave me
this for you. He said you would understand.”
And the doctor laid in Nancy’s palm a tiny
figure of the Good Sainte Anne, the exact
duplicate of her own, save that its silver base
bore the arms of St. Jacques and, beneath, two
plain initials: <span class='it'>N</span> and <span class='it'>H</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A week later, Nancy rose from her knees
beside her father’s open trunk, and stood staring
down into the courtyard. Wrapped to his
ears, the old habitant still sat on his block in
the corner, peeling potatoes without end. Far
above his head, a stray shaft of sunshine gilded
the gray wall and reminded Nancy of her resolution
to take a final walk, that morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was almost with a feeling of relief that
Nancy saw the approaching end of her stay at
The Maple Leaf. The past days had held
some of the saddest hours she had ever known.
Till then, she had never realized how the bright,
brave personality of the sturdy little Frenchman
had pervaded the place, how acutely she could
mourn for a man of whom, less than six weeks
before, she had never even heard. Forget
him she could not. She and Brock talked of
him by the hour, now laughing over the merry
days they had spent together, then giving up
to the sudden wave of loneliness which swept
over them at the thought of the <span class='it'>nevermore</span> that
separated them from their good comrade. As
yet, it was too soon for them to take comfort
from the doctor’s words, that the swift passing
of Adolphe St. Jacques had been but the merciful
forestalling of a pitiful, lingering death in
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To one day, Nancy never made any allusion.
That was the day she had spent alone, at the
shrine of the Good Sainte Anne.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, as she stood before her mirror, fastening
on her hat, her glance fell to the little
figure of the good saint and, taking it up, she
looked long at the symbols graven on its base.
She hesitated. Then she gently slid it into
the breast pocket of her coat. In loyalty to
St. Jacques, it still should be her companion.
His eyes now, in the clearer light, could see
what had before been hidden from them.
Adolphe St. Jacques was too unselfishly loyal
to fail to understand the nature of the only
love she could ever have given him and,
understanding, to reject it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Inside the city wall, the early snow had
vanished; but it still lay white over the Cove
Fields, over the ruins of the old French fortifications,
and over the plains beyond. Beyond
Saint Sauveur, the hills were blue in the sunshine,
and the light wind that swept in from
their snowy caps, was crisp and full of ozone.
Nancy had left The Maple Leaf with slow
step and drooping head; she went tramping
along the Grand Allée as if the world were all
before her, to be had for the mere sake of asking.
Then, as she turned again and halted by the
Wolfe monument, her buoyant mood forsook
her. That simple shaft marked the end of
one who died, victorious. It spoke no word
of those others, Frenchmen, brave, true-hearted
fellows who fell there in their hour of defeat.
And not one of them was braver, more true-hearted
than little Adolphe St. Jacques.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Miss Howard.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Impatiently she raised her head from the
cold iron palings. Barth was standing close at
her side. Even as she nodded to him, she felt
a sudden shrinking from his inevitable question
as to the cause for her tears. To her
surprise, no question came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“After all, he was a wonderfully good little
fellow,” Barth said simply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She nodded, without speaking. Barth let
full five minutes pass, before he spoke again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I saw you go by the house,” he said then.
“I fancied you would come out here. I knew
you liked the place.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And so I followed you. I wanted to see
you, if I could. Miss Howard, I shall miss
you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad of that. It would be dreary to
feel that no one mourned for our departure.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes,” Barth agreed. “Shall we go on
for a little walk?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With one last look at the shaft and its
deathless words, Nancy turned and followed
him back to the Grand Allée, back from the
place of the dead to the haunts of the living.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you go, to-morrow?” Barth asked,
after another pause.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“To-morrow noon.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is going to be very lonely,” he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am glad,” she repeated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even to Barth’s conservative mind, the conversation
did not appear to be making much
progress. He turned and peered into Nancy’s
thoughtful face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, Miss Howard, would you be willing
to give me your address?” he asked abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of course, if you wish it,” she assented
cordially.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather! I might call on you, you know,
if I ever went to The States.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be delightful. So you think
you will come across the border?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Perhaps. I have often wondered, just lately,
you know, what I would think of The States.
What do you think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That I love them,” Nancy said loyally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, yes. But what do you think that I
would think?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy laughed outright, as she met his
anxious eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That it is never safe to predict. I advise
you to come and see for yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth’s face cleared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, you know. And the address?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I haven’t any cards here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but I have.” And Barth hastily took
out his cardcase. Then, with infinite difficulty,
he focussed upon a card the tip of the little
gold pencil that dangled from his watchchain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nancy dictated the address. Then she
laughed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The idea of tying your pencil to you!”
she commented irreverently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why not? Then one doesn’t lose it, you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, I do know. It reminds me of the
way I used to have my mittens sewed to the
ends of a piece of braid,” Nancy responded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barth looked up from his half-written card.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Really? How interesting! But, Miss
Howard—” He halted abruptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What now?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“About The States. You feel they are the
only place to live in?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Certainly,” Nancy replied promptly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh. Have you ever been to England?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No.” Nancy began to wonder at the
antiquity of British customs. At this rate of
progress, it would take aeons for a Britisher
to evolve a custom of any sort. Already her
mind had outstripped the deliberate mental
processes of Barth. She also began to wonder
impatiently how long it would take him to
come to the point. There seemed to her
something inhuman in allowing him to remain
on the rack of suspense. Nevertheless, she
felt that it would be altogether unseemly for
her to refuse anything before she was asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t you want to go to England?”
Barth continued calmly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, of course. I want to visit it. However,
that doesn’t mean that I wish to take
up my abode there.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh. I am sorry. Still,” Barth went on
meditatively; “I dare say one could make
out very well, even if he had to live in The
States.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I certainly expect to,” Nancy responded
coolly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again he peered into her face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh; but I don’t refer to you,” he said
hastily. “I was speaking of myself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But I thought you were going out to a
ranch.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That was before I met you,” Barth answered,
with quiet directness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Suddenly a change came over him. Throwing
back his shoulders, he faced Nancy with
a resolution which brought new lustre to his
eyes, new lines of character into his boyish face.
And Nancy, as she saw the change in him,
trembled for the decision which, with infinite
difficulty, she had long been fixing in her girlish
mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Howard,” he asked abruptly; “do
you believe in the Good Sainte Anne?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without speaking, Nancy let her hand rest
lightly on the little silver image in the pocket
of her coat. Then she nodded in silence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So do I,” Barth answered. “I am not a
Catholic; still, I believe that the good lady has
had me in her keeping, and I trust she may
continue her care for me. Miss Howard, I
am English; you are American, very American
indeed. However, different as we are, I
think our lives need each other. I had never
thought,” he hesitated; then, cap in hand, he
stood looking directly into her blushing face;
“I had never supposed that my life could hold
a love like what has grown into it. I dare not
face that life without—Miss Howard,” he
added, with a swift change to the simple boyishness
which became him so well; “my life
is all yours, to do what you like with. I shall
try to meet your decision bravely; but I do
hope you won’t throw me to one side, as of no
use.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Nancy walked on without answering;
and Barth, still cap in hand, moved on at her
side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It began a long while ago,” he added at
length. “I really think it must have started,
that day at the shrine of Sainte Anne.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Again Nancy’s hand caressed the little image
in her pocket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I think perhaps it did,” she assented.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a moment, Barth walked on in silence,
unable to construe her words into the phrase
which he was waiting to hear. Then he spoke
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I went out to Sainte Anne-de-Beaupré,
one morning last week,” he said slowly. “It
was very desolate there, at this season. I
walked out on the pier. Then I went back
and sat in the church for quite a long time,
and I thought about things. Miss Howard,
I wish I had never given you that guinea.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With an odd little laugh, which was yet
half a sob, Nancy put her hand into her
pocket, felt about underneath the little silver
image, and slowly drew out a shining bit of
gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here it is, Mr. Barth,” she said. “Take
it back, if you wish it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking it from her outstretched hand, he
stared at it intently for a moment. Then he
held it out to her again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you have carried it, all this time?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” she confessed reluctantly. “Only
lately.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, but—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I have called it my lucky penny,” she interrupted,
with a smile. “I had never supposed
you would regret giving it to me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Still with the coin in the hollow of his hand,
he put on his glasses and peered into her face.
He read there something which he had missed
in her tone. Dropping his glasses again, he
held out the shining golden guinea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Please take it back again,” he said, and in
his voice there came a sudden imperious accent
which was new to Nancy. “And, when you
take it, take me, too. We both are yours,
you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The girl moved steadily on for a step or
two, her eyes fixed upon the strip of path
before her. Then her step lagged a little and,
turning, she smiled up into Barth’s troubled,
waiting eyes, while she held out her hand for
the coin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Give it back to me, then,” she said quietly.
“It is mine.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“With all it must mean,—Nancy?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes. With all it does mean.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Their hands met about the shining piece of
gold, and it was an instant before they dropped
apart again. Then Barth gave a contented
little sigh.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now,” he said slowly; “now at last
I really can call you my Good Sainte Anne.
Oh, rather!”</p>
